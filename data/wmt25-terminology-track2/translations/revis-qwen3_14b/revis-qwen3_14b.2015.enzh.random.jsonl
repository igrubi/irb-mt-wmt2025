{"en":"# Highlights of 2015\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderates, reflecting weaker domestic demand and subdued export performance. Local stock market sees large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market starts to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February.\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remains resilient. Locally incorporated authorized institutions (AIs) are well capitalised, and the liquidity positions of AIs continue to be sound. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorates slightly, but stays at healthy levels.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchang rate remains broadly stable against the US dollar, with the strong-side Convertibility Undertaking triggered repeatedly in April, September and October. The Hong Kong dollar exchange rate market continues to operate in an orderly manner despite turbulent global financial market conditions, reflecting resilience of the Linked Exchange Rate System to external shocks.\n\nThe money market continues to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. Following the decision of the US Federal Reserve to raise the target range for the Federal Funds Rate, the Base Rate in Hong Kong is adjusted upwards by 25 basis points to 0.75% in December.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nSupervisory efforts on AIs’ risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products, have been stepped up.\n\nThe HKMA announces a countercyclical capital buffer for Hong Kong and designates five authorized institutions as domestic systemically important banks. Legislative proposals to establish a resolution regime for financial institutions in Hong Kong and enhance the Deposit Protection Scheme by achieving faster payouts are respectively introduced into the Legislative Council.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\nThe HKMA continues to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre. Legislative proposal to improve the tax environment for promoting Hong Kong as a hub for corporate treasury centres is introduced into the Legislative Council in December.\n\nHong Kong remains the global offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. The Mainland-Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds initiative is implemented in July, further expanding Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nHong Kong’s financial infrastructure is further enhanced by the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, allowing customers to issue and deposit cheques online. A new regulatory regime which provides for licensing of multipurpose stored value facilities and designation of important retail payment systems commences operation in November.\n\n# Reserves Management\nAmid the challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund records an overall investment return of -0.6%. Total assets of the Fund reach HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015.\n\nthe HKMA quickens the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totals HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounting to HK$122.4 billion.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. Corporate governance is further improved by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing it security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives and the increasing complexity of work.","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

2015年重點摘要\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟增長減慢，反映本地需求轉弱及出口表現欠佳。本地股市在全球金融市場波動加劇下出現大幅上落。住宅物業市場在2月公布第七輪審慎措施後開始回軟。\n\n香港銀行業維持穩健。本地註冊的認可機構（AIs）資本充裕，認可機構的流動性狀況繼續保持良好。零售銀行的資產質素輕微轉差，但處於健康水平。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n港元匯率大致維持穩定，強方兌換承擔在4月、9月及10月多次被觸發。儘管全球金融市場情況動盪，港元匯率市場繼續有序運作，反映聯繫匯率制度對外部衝擊的韌性。\n\n貨幣市場繼續正常運作，銀行間流動性充裕。繼美國聯邦儲備委員會決定上調聯邦基金利率目標範圍後，香港基準利率於12月上調25個基點至0.75%。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n加強對認可機構風險治理的監管力度，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施，以及投資與保險產品的銷售行為。\n\n香港金融管理局宣布在香港實施逆周期資本緩衝機制，並指定五家授權機構為本地系統重要銀行。有關在香港建立金融機構解決機制及透過加快發放補償以優化存款保障計劃的立法建議，分別提交至立法會。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n香港金融管理局繼續積極參與國際及地區會議，同時不遺餘力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力。為改善稅務環境以助發展香港成為企業財務中心樞紐的立法建議，已於12月提交立法會。\n\n香港維持全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐地位，市場具有相當的深度和廣度。內地與香港基金互認安排於7月實施，進一步豐富香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港的金融基礎設施因於12月成功推出e-Cheque服務而進一步增強，方便客戶在網上簽發及存入支票。一套新的監管制度將於11月實施，該制度為多用途儲值設施發牌，並指定重要的零售支付系統。\n\n# 儲備管理  \n在艱鉅嚴苛的投資環境下，儲備基金的整體投資回報為-0.6%。截至2015年底，基金總資產達34,229億港元。\n\n香港金融管理局加快投資多元化步伐，特別是透過長期增長組合（LTGP）進行投資。截至2015年底，LTGP項下的投資市值總計為1,421億港元，包括913億港元的私募股權及508億港元的房地產投資，未償還的投資承諾為1,224億港元。\n\n# 企業職能\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Corporate Functions,\" and the task is to translate it into Traditional Chinese. The dictionary is empty, so no specific terms need to be translated using predefined equivalents. However, the junior translators have provided several variations, and a critical evaluation is necessary.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: # 企業功能**  \n   - **Strengths:** The term \"企業功能\" is a direct and commonly used translation for \"corporate functions.\" The use of the hash symbol (#) is consistent with the original format.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** While grammatically correct, \"功能\" (function) may be slightly more technical or less natural in this context compared to \"職能.\"\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: # 企業功能**  \n   - **Strengths:** Identical to the first translation, so the same strengths and weaknesses apply.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: # 公司職能**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"公司職能\" is also a valid translation, with \"公司\" (company) being a slightly more general term than \"企業\" (corporate). \"職能\" (duties or functions) is more natural in the context of organizational roles.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"公司\" may be less formal than \"企業,\" which is often used in corporate or business contexts.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: 企業功能**  \n   - **Strengths:** The translation is accurate and concise.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The absence of the hash symbol (#) may be inconsistent with the original format, though it is not a major issue.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: 企業職能**  \n   - **Strengths:** \"企業職能\" is a natural and fluent translation, with \"職能\" being more appropriate for describing the roles or responsibilities of a corporation.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The absence of the hash symbol is similar to the fourth translation.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: # 企業職能**  \n   - **Strengths:** This translation is both accurate and stylistically consistent with the original format. \"職能\" is more natural in this context than \"功能.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nWhile \"企業功能\" is a valid translation, \"職能\" is more commonly used in the context of organizational roles and responsibilities, making it more natural and appropriate for \"functions\" in a corporate setting. Additionally, the inclusion of the hash symbol (#) is consistent with the original format, and \"企業\" is more formal and appropriate for corporate contexts than \"公司.\"\nTherefore, the best possible translation is **# 企業職能**.\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及各種其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以增進對其政策及運作的了解。透過推動員工專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律、加強資訊安全，以及重整高層管理人員之間的職責分工，有助應付推行新措施及工作日益繁重所帶來的挑戰，進一步優化企業治理。"}
{"en":"# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nThe Hong Kong economy experienced slower growth in 2015 reflecting weaker domestic demand and poor export performance. Economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft amid stiff external headwinds and fragile financial market conditions.\n\n# THE ECONOMY IN REVIEW\n\n# Overview\n\nEconomic growth in Hong Kong moderated during the year, with real Gross Domestic Product (GDP) growth slowing to 2.4% from 2.6% in 2014 (Table 1). This reflected milder expansion in domestic demand, although net exports reverted to a positive contributor to GDP growth as total imports declined faster than total exports (Chart 1). Despite the modest economic performance, the labour market held broadly stable, with the unemployment rate staying low at about 3.3%. Inflation eased further due to subsiding pressures on domestic costs and import prices. Local stock prices saw large swings amid heightened volatility in global financial markets. The residential property market started to soften after the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February, with housing prices showing further signs of consolidation towards the end of the year.\n\nChart 1 Real GDP growth by contribution\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nTable 1 Real GDP growth by expenditure component (period-over-period)\n\nNote: The seasonally-adjusted quarter-on-quarter rates of change in the gross domestic fixed capital formation are not available.\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\nOn the monetary front, exchange-rate stability was maintained in 2015, with the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate hovering near 7.75 against the US dollar. The strong-side Convertibility Undertaking was triggered in April due to equity-related inflows, and again in September and October reflecting conversions of the offshore renminbi into Hong Kong dollars and some commercial demand for Hong Kong dollars. With the enlarged Aggregate Balance, local interest rates continued to stay low, while the HKMA Base Rate was adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% following the US interest rate lift-off in mid-December. Because of softer credit demand, total loan growth in the banking sector slowed further to 3.5% in 2015 from 12.7% in 2014. The banking industry's overall loan quality weakened slightly, but the classified loan ratios remained at low levels.\n\n# Domestic demand\n\nDomestic demand grew at a slower pace in 2015. While broadly stable job and income conditions continued to provide support, weak consumer confidence and corrections in asset prices weighed on private consumption growth in the second half of the year. However, due to the relatively strong growth momentum in the first half, the full-year growth in private consumption increased to 4.8% from 3.3% in 2014. Government consumption increased slightly faster by 3.4%. In fact, the slower growth in domestic demand was mainly due to the 2.2% decline in gross domestic fixed capital formation (Chart 2). Private-sector machinery and equipment acquisition contracted for the second consecutive year amid deteriorating business sentiment, and building and construction activities also showed weaker growth momentum alongside slower progress in public projects.\n\n# External demand\n\nHong Kong’s export performance deteriorated in 2015 (Chart 3). Exports of goods recorded a broad-based 1.7% decline, the first time since 2009. Exports to Japan and the European Union declined, while those to the US recorded little growth. The feeble final demand from these advanced markets also weighed on regional industrial activities and intra-regional trade. As a result, Hong Kong’s exports to Mainland China, Singapore, South Korea and Taiwan also decreased amid weak intermediate and final demand from these economies. Hong Kong’s exports of services continued to moderate from a high growth path in earlier years, which culminated in a 0.6% decline in 2015, mainly due to the slowdown in inbound tourism. Imports of goods also fell back alongside weaker domestic and export-induced demand. In contrast, growth in imports of services accelerated due to strong travel interest among local residents. On a net basis, the overall trade surplus improved slightly in 2015, leading to a modest positive contribution to GDP growth.\n\nChart 2 Domestic demand\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Inflation\n\nUnderlying inflation eased further in 2015 amid moderated domestic cost pressures and reduced import price inflation. After netting out the effects of the Government's one-off relief measures, the underlying inflation rate dropped to 2.5% from 3.5% in 2014 (Chart 4). With subdued economic activity, labour cost pressures remained steady, while commercial and industrial rental cost pressures eased, particularly in the second half. Thanks to softened global commodity prices and the strong Hong Kong dollar, import price pressures abated, while food inflation also stayed low. As the feed-through of fresh-letting housing rentals in earlier quarters had been moderate, the rental component of inflation remained contained.\n\nChart 3 Exports of goods and services\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\nChart 4 Underlying consumer price inflation\nSource: Census and Statistics Department.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# Labour market\n\nLabour market conditions remained stable in 2015. Labour demand held up, with the decline in employment in trade and tourism-related sectors being largely offset by the steady pace of hiring in other business sectors, resulting in an increase in total employment of 1.3% from a year earlier. With labour supply also picking up by 1.3%, the seasonally adjusted unemployment rate stayed at around 3.3% throughout the year (Chart 5). Given the still-tight labour market, labour earnings in nominal terms rose by 4.7% in the first three quarters of the year, compared with 4.3% in 2014. With inflationary pressures easing, real labour earnings increased by 1.3% in the first three quarters, compared with a decline of 0.1% in 2014.\n\n# Stock market\n\nThe Hong Kong stock market experienced a volatile year due to drastic changes in the external environment. After a flat first quarter, the local stock market was buoyant in the second quarter amid the bullish sentiment in the Mainland A-share market and capital inflows. The Hang Seng Index surged to a seven-year high in April, with the Southbound Daily Quota under the Shanghai-Hong Kong Stock Connect being exhausted for the first time since its inception in November 2014 (Chart 6). However, the local market reversed course starting from late June, with the Hang Seng Index plunging 28% to a year-low in September amid the sell-offs in the Mainland A-share market and global stock markets, the heightened volatility in the global foreign exchange market, and weaknesses in international commodity prices. The Hong Kong stock market recovered some ground in the last quarter as global and Mainland financial markets stabilised. For 2015 as a whole, the Hang Seng index recorded a decline of 7.2%, the worst performance since 2011, while the average daily turnover rose to HK$105.6 billion from HK$69.5 billion in 2014. Although fund-raising activities moderated in the second half, the overall equity funds raised from the local stock market increased to HK$1,115.6 billion from HK$942.7 billion a year earlier.\n\n# Property market\n\nSigns of consolidation emerged in the residential property market. After experiencing a buoyant period in early 2015, the residential property market softened following the announcement of the seventh round of prudential measures in February. With housing prices picking up at a slower pace before declining in the last quarter, the cumulative increase in housing prices in 2015 was 2.5%, smaller than the 13.5% increase in 2014 (Chart 6). Meanwhile, the transaction volume decreased by 12.3% from a year ago to 55,982 units as trading activities in the secondary market fell noticeably in the second half. Speculative transactions, including confirmor transactions and short-term flipping trades, continued to stay low. Despite this, household affordability remained stretched, with the price-to-income ratio reaching 15.7 and the income-gearing ratio remaining far above its long-term average. The commercial and industrial property markets were buoyant in the first half, but trading activities then softened, with both prices and rents registering declines in the last quarter. Rental yields remained broadly the same from a year earlier and stayed near their historical lows.\n\nChart 6 Asset prices\nSources: Rating and Valuation Department and Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited.\n\n# Economic and Financial Environment\n\n# OUTLOOK FOR THE ECONOMY\n\n# Economic environment\n\nHong Kong’s economic growth for 2016 is expected to remain soft. Private-sector analysts project the economy to expand at a slower average rate of 1.7% while the Government forecasts growth in the range of 1–2%. More specifically, the lacklustre global growth prospects, sustained weakness in inbound tourism, and the negative spillovers from turbulent global financial market conditions will continue to restrain the performance of Hong Kong’s exports. Domestically, private consumption is anticipated to grow moderately, as labour market conditions will likely face some pressures amid weaker economic momentum, and local asset price adjustments may dent consumer confidence and induce negative wealth effects. Building and construction activities may hold up, but weak business sentiment and interest rate rises will weigh on private capital investment.\n\n# Inflation and the labour market\n\nInflationary pressures are expected to remain contained in 2016. Import price pressures will likely stay soft, while domestic cost pressures are expected to be modest amid moderate economic growth momentum. The rental component of inflation may also ease due to diminishing pressures in fresh-letting housing rentals towards the end of 2015. Market consensus predicts the headline inflation rate at 2.5% in 2016, while the Government projects the underlying inflation rate at 2.0%. The labour market may also soften somewhat due to the slowdown in inbound tourism and continued sluggishness in the export sector. Private-sector analysts now expect the unemployment rate to increase to 3.5% in 2016.\n\n# Uncertainties and risks\n\nThe economic outlook for 2016 is subject to a number of uncertainties and risks. In particular, the pace of further US interest rate rises, the global growth prospects and commodity price movements will continue to be the major sources of uncertainty. Any significant adverse developments could heighten volatilities in global financial markets and international capital flows, thereby tightening domestic monetary and financial conditions and casting a shadow over Hong Kong's growth prospects. The resulting impact of these external factors on the domestic economy will depend crucially on their impact on the property market through the wealth and balance-sheet effects. While the property market is facing increasing downside risks stemming from weakening sentiment in the global and domestic financial markets, the normalisation of US interest rates, and a narrowing housing demand-supply gap, more time is needed to establish whether the property market has entered a down-cycle. Although an abrupt adjustment in the property market could pose significant headwinds to the broader economy, the introduction of counter-cyclical macroprudential measures and other supervisory measures over the past few years has significantly enhanced the resilience of Hong Kong's banking system.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE BANKING SECTOR\n\nThe Hong Kong banking sector remained resilient during the year, notwithstanding a further divergence in the monetary policies of advanced economies and the build-up of vulnerabilities in emerging market economies. The liquidity positions of authorized institutions (AIs) continued to be sound, and locally incorporated AIs were well capitalised. The asset quality of retail banks deteriorated slightly, but stayed at a healthy level.\n\n# Interest rate trends\n\nIn line with the US dollar interest rates, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates were low throughout the year. The Hong Kong dollar funding cost of retail banks declined in the first half of the year as indicated by a downward trend in the composite interest rate, and remained stable in the second half (Chart 7).\n\nChart 7 HIBOR fixings, composite rate and best lending rate (BLR)\nNotes:\n1. HiBoR fixings refer to the Hong Kong Dollar interest Settlement Rates released by the Hong Kong Association of Banks and are monthly averages.\n\n2. BlR refers to the best lending rate quoted by the Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corporation Limited (monthly averages).\n\n\n# Profitability trends\n\nThe profitability of the banking sector moderated in 2015. The aggregate pre-tax operating profits of retail banks' Hong Kong offices declined by 2.8%, as growth in fee and commission income (up 9.7%), foreign exchange and derivatives operation income (up 22.4%), and net interest income (up 1.3%) was offset by an 8.8% increase in operating expenses and a 76% increase in loan impairment charges. However, the post-tax profit of retail banks increased by 14.7%, mainly due to gains from disposals of strategic investments. The post-tax return on average assets of retail banks improved to 1.05% from 0.99% in 2014 (Chart 8).\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

經濟與金融環境\n\n香港經濟在2015年經歷較慢的增長，反映內需轉弱及出口表現欠佳。預計2016年的經濟增長將在嚴峻的外部逆風及脆弱的金融市場情況下保持緩和。\n\n# 經濟回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n香港的經濟增長在本年放緩，實際本地生產總值（GDP）增長從2014年的2.6%降至2.4%（表1）。這反映了內需擴大趨於溫和，儘管淨出口重新成為GDP增長的正數貢獻者，因總進口下跌速度較總出口為快（圖1）。儘管經濟表現溫和，勞動市場大致穩定，失業率全年處於約3.3%的低水平。通脹進一步緩和，因本地成本及進口價格的壓力減緩。本地股市在國際金融市場波動加劇下出現大幅上落。住宅物業市場在2月公布第七輪審慎措施後開始回軟，樓價在年底顯示進一步盤整的跡象。\n\n圖1 實質本地生產總值按貢獻分類的增長  \n資料來源：統計處。\n\n表 1 實質本地生產總值按支出構成增長（期間對期間）\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估這些翻譯時，我們需關注幾個關鍵方面：術語準確性、語法正確性、語句流暢度與文化適切性。\n首先，所有翻譯都正確使用了「表」來對應「Table」，並使用了「本地生產總值」來對應「GDP」，這符合詞典要求。然而，「period」被翻譯為「期間」是正確的，但其後的搭配方式在不同翻譯中表現不一，有些使用「期間比較」或「期對期」，這些雖正確，但「期間對期間」更符合經濟報告中常見的表達方式。\n其次，「Real GDP growth」在翻譯中被處理為「實際GDP成長率」、「實質GDP成長率」、「實質本地生產總值成長」等，其中「實質」與「實際」在經濟術語中均可接受，但「實質」更常見於經濟報告中，因此更為優選。\n再者，「by expenditure component」被翻譯為「按支出構成劃分」、「按支出項目計算」、「以支出組成別計算」、「按支出項目分類」、「按支出組成部分」、「按支出分項」等。其中「按支出構成」與「按支出項目」都正確，但「按支出構成」更貼近「component」的語意，強調構成部分。\n此外，語句結構方面，有些翻譯過於冗長或語序不自然，例如「按支出項目計算的實際GDP成長率（期間對比期間）」語序略顯不自然，而「表 1 實質本地生產總值按支出構成增長（期間對期間）」則語序自然、語意清晰。\n總體而言，最佳翻譯應結合準確的術語、自然的語序與經濟報告中常見的表達方式，因此最終翻譯為：\n**表 1 實質本地生產總值按支出構成增長（期間對期間）**\n\n注意：經季節因素調整的季對季國內固定資本形成變動率目前不可得。資料來源：統計處。\n\n# 經濟與金融環境\n\n在貨幣方面，2015年匯率穩定性得以維持，港元兌美元匯率維持在7.75附近。由於與股權相關的資金流入，強方兌換承諾於4月被觸發，並於9月及10月再次被觸發，反映離岸人民幣轉換為港元及部分商業對港元的需求。隨著總體結餘擴大，本地利率繼續維持在低水平，而香港金融管理局基本利率則在美國於12月中加息後，由0.5%上調至0.75%。由於信貸需求較弱，銀行業總貸款增長進一步放緩至2015年的3.5%，較2014年的12.7%顯著下降。銀行業整體貸款質素輕微削弱，但分類貸款比率仍然維持在低水平。\n\n# 內需\n\n2015年國內需求增長步伐放緩。雖然就業與收入情況大致穩定，持續提供支撐，但消費者信心轉弱及資產價格調整拖累私人消費增長，尤其在下半年表現較弱。然而，由於上半年相對強勁的增長動能，全年私人消費增長從2014年的3.3%提升至4.8%。政府消費則輕微加快至3.4%。事實上，國內需求增長放緩主要歸因於國內固定資本形成額下跌2.2%（見圖2）。私人部門機械設備購置連續第二年收縮，企業情緒惡化背景下，建築與工程活動亦因公共項目進度放緩而顯示出較弱的增長動能。\n\n# 外部需求\n\n香港的出口表現於2015年轉差（圖3）。貨品出口錄得全面下跌1.7%，為自2009年以來首次。對日本及歐洲聯盟的出口下跌，而對美國的出口則增長有限。這些先進市場呆滯的最終需求亦拖累區域內工業活動及區內貿易。結果，香港對中國內地、新加坡、韓國及台灣的出口亦在這些經濟體弱勢的中間及最終需求下下跌。香港的服務出口自早年高增長軌道持續轉弱，最終在2015年錄得0.6%的下跌，主要由於入境旅遊放緩所致。貨物進口亦因本地及出口引致的需求轉弱而回落。相反，服務進口因本地居民強勁的旅遊興趣而加快增長。整體而言，2015年的淨貿易順差輕微優化，對本地生產總值增長作出溫和的正數貢獻。\n\n圖2 國內需求  \n資料來源：統計處。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is concise and straightforward: \"Chart 2 Domestic demand Source: Census and Statistics Department.\" The goal is to translate this into fluent and natural Traditional Chinese while adhering to the provided dictionary.\n**Translation Evaluation:**\n1. **First junior translator:**  \n   \"圖2 國內需求 資料來源：人口統計處\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"圖\" for \"Chart,\" \"資料來源\" for \"Source,\" and \"國內需求\" for \"Domestic demand.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"人口統計處\" is a direct translation of \"Census and Statistics Department,\" but it is not the standard term used in Hong Kong or other regions. The official name should be \"統計處\" (Statistics Department), as it is commonly used in official contexts.\n2. **Second junior translator:**  \n   \"圖2 內地需求  \n   資料來源：統計處。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses \"圖\" and \"資料來源\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"內地需求\" translates to \"Mainland demand,\" which is not the intended meaning of \"Domestic demand.\" \"內地\" typically refers to the mainland of China, which may not be appropriate in a general context.\n3. **Third junior translator:**  \n   \"圖 2 國內需求  \n   資料來源：部門。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"圖\" and \"國內需求.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"部門\" is the dictionary term for \"department,\" but it is not appropriate here. The source should be \"統計處,\" not \"部門.\"\n4. **Fourth junior translator:**  \n   \"圖2 國內需求 資料來源：統計處。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"圖,\" \"國內需求,\" and \"資料來源.\" \"統計處\" is the correct term for \"Census and Statistics Department\" in this context.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The spacing and punctuation are slightly inconsistent, but this is a minor issue.\n5. **Fifth junior translator:**  \n   \"圖 2 國內需求  \n   資料來源： Census and Statistics Department。\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"圖\" and \"國內需求.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The English term \"Census and Statistics Department\" is not translated, which violates the dictionary requirement. It should be translated as \"統計處.\"\n6. **Sixth junior translator:**  \n   \"圖2 國內需求  \n   資料來源：統計處\"  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses \"圖,\" \"國內需求,\" and \"資料來源.\" \"統計處\" is the correct term.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The punctuation at the end is missing, which is a minor issue.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nThe best translation should use \"圖\" for \"Chart,\" \"國內需求\" for \"Domestic demand,\" and \"資料來源：統計處\" for \"Source: Census and Statistics Department.\" It should also follow proper punctuation and spacing in Traditional Chinese. Based on the above analysis, the fourth and sixth translations are the closest to the ideal, but the fourth one includes the punctuation correctly.

{"en":"# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable throughout 2015 despite turbulent financial market conditions and the US interest rate lift-off in December. The money market also continued to function normally with ample interbank liquidity. As the cornerstone of Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades, the Linked Exchange Rate System continued to be hiqhly resilient to external shocks.\n\n# OBJECTIVES\n\nThe overriding objective of Hong Kong's monetary policy is currency stability. This is defined as a stable external exchange value of Hong Kong's currency, in terms of its exchange rate in the foreign-exchange market against the US dollar, within a band of HK$7.75 - 7.85 to US$1. The structure of the monetary system is characterised by Currency Board arrangements, requiring the Monetary Base to be at least 100% backed by US dollar reserves held in the Exchange Fund, and changes in the Monetary Base to be 100% matched by corresponding changes in US dollar reserves.\n\nThe Monetary Base (Table 1) comprises\n\n* Certificates of Indebtedness, which provide full backing to the banknotes issued by the three note-issuing banks\n* Government-issued notes and coins in circulation \n* the Aggregate Balance, which is the sum of clearing account balances of banks kept with the HKMA \n* Exchange Fund Bills and Notes issued by the HKMA on behalf of the Government.\n\nThe stability of the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate is maintained through an automatic interest rate adjustment mechanism and the firm commitment by the HKMA to honour the Convertibility Undertakings (CUs). When the demand for Hong Kong dollars is greater than the supply and the market exchange rate strengthens to the strong-side CU of HK$7.75 to one US dollar, the HKMA stands ready to sell Hong Kong dollars to banks for US dollars. The Aggregate Balance will then expand to push down Hong Kong dollar interest rates, creating monetary conditions that move the Hong Kong dollar away from the strong-side limit to within the Convertibility Zone of 7.75 to 7.85. Conversely, if the supply of Hong Kong dollars is greater than demand and the market exchange rate weakens to the weak-side CU of HK$7.85 to one US dollar, the HKMA will buy Hong Kong dollars from banks. The Aggregate Balance will then contract to drive Hong Kong dollar interest rates up, pushing the Hong Kong dollar away from the weak-side limit to stay within the Convertibility Zone.\n\nThe Certificates of Indebtedness and the government-issued currency notes and coins in circulation shown here are stated at Hong Kong dollar face values. The corresponding items shown in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report are in Hong Kong dollars equivalent to the US dollar amounts required for their redemption at the prevailing exchange rates on the balance sheet date. This arrangement is in accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong.\n\nThe amount of EFBN shown here is different from that in the balance sheet of the Exchange Fund in this Annual Report. In accordance with the accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong, the EFBN held by the HKMA on behalf of the Exchange Fund in relation to its trading of the EFBN in the secondary market are offset against the EFBN issued, and the net amount is recorded in the balance sheet.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Exchange-rate stability\n\nThe Hong Kong dollar exchange rate remained broadly stable in 2015, trading within a narrow range of 7.7500 to 7.7657 against the US dollar (Chart 1). In the early part of 2015, the Hong Kong dollar was under slight weakening pressures amid market concerns about the US interest rate lift-off. However, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate strengthened close to 7.75 during the second quarter, with the strong-side CU being triggered repeatedly in April mainly due to a surge in equity-related demand for the Hong Kong dollar amid buoyant stock market activities. Moving into the second half of the year, the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate continued to hover close to 7.75 against the US dollar in August, despite the notable sell-off in Hong Kong and Mainland’s equity markets, and increased volatilities in the global currency markets (including the renminbi). Driven by conversions of the offshore renminbi into the Hong Kong dollar, the strong-side CU was triggered again in September and October. While the US Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) raised the target range for the Federal Funds Rate by 25 basis points in mid-December, the Hong Kong dollar continued to move within a tight range against the US dollar without notable outflow pressures. Overall, the Hong Kong dollar exchange market operated in an orderly manner throughout 2015, despite the turbulent global financial market conditions.\n\nChart 1 Market exchange rate in 2015\n\nAs the strong-side CU was repeatedly triggered in April, September and October, the HKMA passively purchased a total of US$29.3 billion from banks in exchange for HK$227.2 billion, in accordance with the Currency Board principles. This led to a corresponding expansion in the Aggregate Balance, with part of the expansion being offset by additional issuance of Exchange Fund Bills in response to banks’ strong demand for liquidity management (Chart 2). The additional issuance of Exchange Fund paper is consistent with Currency Board principles, as it represents a change in the composition of the Monetary Base with the Monetary Base fully backed by foreign exchange reserves. The total of Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund Bills and notes increased to HK$1,221.0 billion at the end of 2015 from HK$992.5 billion a year earlier.\n\nChart 2 Aggregate Balance and outstanding Exchange Fund paper in 2015\n\n# Money market\n\nWith ample liquidity in the banking system, Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates remained low throughout 2015. As the target range for the US Federal Funds Rate was adjusted upwards from 0–0.25% to 0.25–0.5% on 16 December (US time), the Base Rate was also adjusted upwards from 0.5% to 0.75% on 17 December according to the pre-set formula. For 2015 as a whole, interbank interest rates for tenors from overnight to three months stayed below the Base Rate (Chart 3), with moderate fluctuations driven by banks’ seasonal liquidity needs and tightened liquidity amid volatile financial market conditions in August. Broadly tracking the spreads between the Hong Kong Interbank Offered Rate (HIBOR) and the London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), the Hong Kong dollar forward points turned to notable premiums in August amid tightened market liquidity, and then subsequently dipped into discounts towards the end of the year due to the broad-based increases in the US dollar interest rates (Chart 4). Overall, the money market continued to function normally. Discount Window borrowing was not active, amounting to only HK$2.8 billion in 2015.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nChart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015\n\nChart 4 Hong Kong dollar forward points in 2015\n\n# Linked Exchange Rate System\n\nSince its establishment in 1983, the Linked Exchange Rate System (LERS) has continued to function smoothly and contributed significantly to Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability over the past few decades. Given Hong Kong's small and open economy and its role as an international financial hub, the LERS remains the most suitable exchange rate regime for Hong Kong. The Hong Kong SAR Government is firmly committed to maintaining the LERS. Indeed, stability in the foreign exchange and money markets further reinforces the credibility of the Government's commitment, and the public continues to have strong confidence in the Hong Kong dollar as a means of payment and storage of value. In its 2015 Article IV consultation with Hong Kong, the International Monetary Fund (IMF) continued to endorse the LERS as the best monetary arrangement for Hong Kong, citing Hong Kong's robust institutional, legal and policy framework, ample fiscal reserves, flexible markets, and sound financial system as key factors supporting the smooth functioning of the LERS.\n\nGiven that a robust banking system is crucial to the normal functioning of the LERS, the HKMA continued to closely monitor banks' management of credit, liquidity and interest rate risks and stress-test results, and stepped up its supervisory efforts on banks' corporate and property-related lending to enhance the resilience of the banking sector. In view of the rise in US interest rates, the HKMA reminded the public to make necessary preparations in managing risks, noting that any triggering of the weak-side CU and outflow of Hong Kong dollars are a natural and necessary step in the process of the normalisation of the Hong Kong dollar interest rates.\n\nTo improve the transparency of the Currency Board Account, a specific portion of Exchange Fund assets has been allocated to back the Monetary Base since October 1998. The Backing Ratio (defined as the Backing Assets divided by the Monetary Base) moved within a narrow range of 106.3-107.5% during 2015, without touching the Upper or Lower Trigger Level. The ratio closed at 106.3% on 31 December (Chart 5). Under the LERS, while specific Exchange Fund assets have been designated for the Backing Portfolio, all Exchange Fund assets are available to support the Hong Kong dollar exchange rate. The large amount of financial resources of the Fund provides a powerful backstop to protect Hong Kong's monetary and financial stability in the event of abrupt shocks.\n\nChart 5 Daily movement of the Backing Ratio in 2015\n\n# Other activities\n\nThe Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC) Currency Board Sub-Committee monitors and reviews issues relevant to monetary and financial stability in Hong Kong. In 2015, the Sub-Committee considered issues including the supply of international US dollar loans by global banks, the international use of macro-prudential measures, the implications of US interest rate hikes for Hong Kong's property market, the formula for the determination of the Base Rate, macroeconomic implications of the Hong Kong dollar real effective exchange rate rise, and the sovereign risk of emerging market economies. Records of the Sub-Committee’s discussions and the reports on Currency Board operations submitted to the Sub-Committee are published on the HKMA website.\n\n# Monetary Stability\n\nThe Hong Kong Institute for Monetary Research (HKIMR) continued to sponsor research in the fields of monetary policy, banking and finance. In 2015, the Institute hosted 16 research fellows and published 27 working papers.\n\nThe Institute organised five international conferences and workshops. The main ones included:\n\n* The Sixth Annual International Conference on the Chinese Economy in January, under the title \"Leverage and Financial System Efficiency and Stability: Chinese and International Experiences\". 11 high quality research papers were presented at the conference, covering an extensive range of issues such as corporate leverage in China, China's credit boom and business cycle, banking competition and financial stability, as well as banking regulation and credit supply.\n* The HKIMR and the University of Hong Kong joint conference entitled \"HKIMR-HKU International Conference on Finance, Institutions and Economic Growth\" in May. The conference covered many different economic issues, including banking and monetary policy, international financing and cross border mergers and acquisitions, design of financial regulation, as well as macroeconomic environment and capital markets.\n* The HKIMR, the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System, the European Central Bank and the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallas joint conference in October on \"Diverging Monetary Policies, Global Capital Flows and Financial Stability\". The conference examined a wide range of issues including the relationship between monetary policies, international capital flows and exchange rates, divergent monetary policies and their implications for global financial stability, spillover of major central bank policies to other parts of the world, and the costs and benefits of global policy co-ordination.\n\nThe Institute also hosted its 13th HKIMR Summer Workshop in August, and the 13th HKIMR Conference on the Mainland Economy in September, addressing issues on fiscal reform and local government financing in Mainland China. The conferences and workshops were attended by participants from academia, the financial services industry and global central banks. In addition, the Institute held 24 public seminars during the year covering a broad range of economic, monetary and financial issues.\n\n# Notes and coins\n\nAt the end of 2015, the total value of banknotes in circulation was HK$360.2 billion, an increase of 5.3% from a year earlier (Charts 6, 7 and 8). The total value of government-issued notes and coins in circulation amounted to HK$11.2 billion, up 2.9% (Charts 9 and 10). The value of government-issued HK$10 notes in circulation was HK$4.0 billion, of which 85% were polymer notes.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

貨幣穩定性\n\n香港貨幣兌換率在2015年全年大致穩定，儘管面對動盪的金融市場情況及美國於12月的利率升息。貨幣市場亦繼續正常運作，銀行間流動性充裕。作為香港過去數十年貨幣及金融穩定的基石，聯繫匯率制度繼續對外來衝擊表現出高度穩健。\n\n# 目標\n\n香港貨幣政策的主要目的是貨幣穩定。這被定義為香港貨幣在外汇市場上對美元的匯率於HK$7.75至7.85兌1美元的區間內保持穩定。貨幣制度的結構特徵是貨幣發行局制度，規定貨幣基礎必須至少有百分之百由存於發行基金的美元儲備所支持，且貨幣基礎的變動必須百分之百配合美元儲備的相應變動。\n\n貨幣基礎（表1）包括\n\n*負債證明書，為三家發行銀行發行的紙幣提供十足支持  \n*政府發行並處於流通中的紙幣和硬幣  \n*總體餘額，即銀行在金管局開設的清算賬戶餘額總額  \n*由金管局代表政府發行的 Exchange Fund 票據和紙幣\n\n香港貨幣兌換率的穩定是透過自動利率調整機制及香港金融管理局（HKMA）堅決履行兌換保證（CUs）的承諾而維持。當對港元的需求大於供應，且市場兌換率轉強至每美元7.75港元的強方兌換保證時，香港金融管理局會準備向銀行出售港元以換取美元。總體結餘將隨之擴大，推低港元利率，創造貨幣情況，使港元由強方上限回復至7.75至7.85的兌換範圍內。相反，若港元供應大於需求，且市場兌換率轉弱至每美元7.85港元的弱方兌換保證時，香港金融管理局將向銀行買入港元。總體結餘將隨之收縮，推動港元利率上升，使港元由弱方上限回復至7.75至7.85的兌換範圍內。\n\n在此所示的負債證明書及政府發行並流通中的紙幣和硬幣，均以港元面值計算。本年度報告中匯兌基金的資產負債表所載的相應項目，以港元表示，等值於根據資產負債表日期的現行匯率兌換所需美元數額。此安排是根據香港普遍接受的會計原則進行的。\n\n此處顯示的EFBN金額與本年度報告中交易所基金資產負債表所載金額不同。根據香港普遍接受的會計原則，香港金融管理局代表交易所基金持有與其在二級市場交易EFBN有關的EFBN，這些EFBN已與發行的EFBN抵銷，淨額記錄在資產負債表中。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 經濟穩定性\n\n港元兌美元匯率在2015年大致穩定，於7.7500至7.7657之間窄幅波動（圖1）。2015年初，市場對美國加息的憂慮令港元承受輕微轉弱壓力。然而，第二季港元兌美元匯率回升至接近7.75水平，主要由於股市活動活躍，引致與股權相關的港元需求急升，導致4月多次觸發強方兌換保證。踏入下半年，儘管香港及內地股市出現顯著拋售，以及全球貨幣市場（包括人民幣）波動增加，港元對美元匯率在8月仍維持於接近7.75水平。9月及10月，受離岸人民幣兌換港元拆倉推動，強方兌換保證再次被觸發。雖然美國聯邦公開市場委員會（FOMC）於12月中將聯邦基金利率目標範圍上調25個基點，港元對美元匯率全年仍維持於窄幅範圍內波動，沒有顯著流出壓力。整體而言，儘管全球金融市場環境動盪，2015年港元匯率市場仍有序運作。\n\n圖一 二零一五年市場匯率\n圖1 2015年市場匯率\n圖1 市場匯率 2015年\n圖 1 2015年市場匯率\n圖1 2015年市場匯率\n圖1 2015年市場匯率\nReview:\n所有翻譯都正確使用了「圖」來翻譯「Chart」，符合詞彙對應要求。然而，從語法和語感的角度來看，第一個翻譯「圖一 二零一五年市場匯率」使用了「二零一五年」，這在正式文件中較為常見，語氣較為正式；而其他翻譯使用「2015年」，較為簡潔。此外，「圖1」與「圖 1」之間的空格差異，雖然不影響理解，但在正式文件中通常會統一格式。\n從語序來看，「圖1 2015年市場匯率」語序自然，符合中文表達習慣，而「圖1 市場匯率 2015年」語序略顯混亂，可能引起誤解。\n綜合考量語法、語感與格式統一性，最佳翻譯應為「圖1 2015年市場匯率」，語序自然、格式統一，且符合常見的標題格式。\nTranslation:\n圖1 2015年市場匯率\n\n由於強方兌換保證在4月、9月及10月多次被觸發，香港金融管理局根據貨幣發行局原則，被動地從銀行購入總值293億美元，換取2,272億港元。這導致總體結餘相應擴大，其中部分擴大被增發的外匯基金票據所抵銷，以回應銀行對流動性管理的強烈需求（圖2）。增發外匯基金票據符合貨幣發行局原則，因為這顯示貨幣基礎組成的改變，而貨幣基礎則全面由外匯儲備支持。總體結餘與未償還的外匯基金票據及紙幣總額，由2014年底的9,925億港元增至2015年底的12,210億港元。\n\n圖2 總體結餘及2015年未償還的外匯基金紙幣\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各份翻譯時，首先需確認字典中指定的詞彙是否正確使用。根據字典，\"aggregate\" 應翻譯為「總體」，而 \"Chart\" 應翻譯為「圖」。所有翻譯均正確使用了這些詞彙，因此這一點無需修正。\n接下來，評估翻譯的語法、流暢度與文化適切性：\n1. **第一份翻譯**：「圖2 總體餘額及2015年未償付交換基金紙幣」  \n   - 用詞較為直譯，「餘額」與「未償付」語感較生硬，且「交換基金」不如「外匯基金」常見。\n2. **第二份翻譯**：「圖2 2015年總體結餘及未償還的外匯基金紙幣」  \n   - 「結餘」比「餘額」更符合財務語境，「未償還」語感自然，「外匯基金」用詞準確。\n3. **第三份翻譯**：「圖2 2015年總體餘額及未償還外匯基金紙幣」  \n   - 「總體餘額」語感稍顯生硬，「未償還」語感自然，但「餘額」不如「結餘」常用於財務報告。\n4. **第四份翻譯**：「圖2 總體結餘及二零一五年未償還的結匯基金票據」  \n   - 「結匯基金」與「票據」用詞不常見，與原文「Exchange Fund paper」語意不完全對應，且「二零一五年」雖正確，但「2015年」更符合現代中文用法。\n5. **第五份翻譯**：「圖2 總體結餘及2015年金管局未償還債務」  \n   - 「金管局」為機構名稱，但原文並未提及，屬於誤譯；「債務」與「paper」語意不符。\n6. **第六份翻譯**：「圖2 2015年總體結餘及未償發票基金紙幣」  \n   - 「未償發票」語意不清，與「outstanding」不符；「發票基金」為誤譯。\n**改進方向：**  \n- 使用「結餘」比「餘額」更符合財務語境。  \n- 「外匯基金」比「交換基金」或「結匯基金」更常見且準確。  \n- 「未償還」比「未償付」或「未償發票」更自然。  \n- 年份使用「2015年」比「二零一五年」更符合現代中文用法。  \n- 避免添加原文未提及的機構名稱（如「金管局」）。\n**最佳翻譯：**  \n圖2 總體結餘及2015年未償還的外匯基金紙幣\n\n# 貨幣市場\n\n在銀行體系流動性充裕的情況下，港元銀行間利率於2015年全年保持低位。美國聯邦基金利率目標範圍於美國時間12月16日由0–0.25%上調至0.25–0.5%後，根據預設公式，基準利率亦於12月17日上調至0.75%。整體而言，2015年銀行間利率從隔夜至三個月期均低於基準利率（圖3），波動幅度輕微，主要受銀行季節性流動性需求及8月金融市場情況波動導致流動性收緊所影響。大致跟隨香港銀行同業拆息（HIBOR）與倫敦銀行同業拆息（LIBOR）之間的差距，港元遠期點數於8月市場流動性收緊期間轉為顯著溢價，其後因美元利率普遍上調，年底時段則回落至折讓（圖4）。整體而言，貨幣市場繼續正常運作，貼現窗借款並不活躍，2015年僅為28億港元。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n圖3 2015年香港銀行同業拆息利率\nThe original English text is \"Chart 3 Hong Kong dollar interbank interest rates in 2015.\" The key term to be translated exactly is \"Chart,\" which should be translated as \"圖\" according to the dictionary. The rest of the text should be translated naturally into Traditional Chinese.\nThe junior translators have provided several translations, each with its own merits and drawbacks:\n1. The first junior translator's translation is \"圖3 2015年港元銀行間利率.\" This translation is concise and accurate, but \"港元\" is a colloquial term for \"Hong Kong dollar,\" which may not be as formal as \"香港美元.\"\n2. The second junior translator's translation is \"圖3：2015年港元銀行間利率.\" This translation is similar to the first, but the use of a colon after \"圖3\" is not typical in Traditional Chinese titles and may be considered less natural.\n3. The third junior translator's translation is \"圖3 2015年香港銀行間利率.\" This translation is accurate, but \"香港銀行間利率\" may not be the most precise term for \"interbank interest rates\" in the context of Hong Kong dollars.\n4. The fourth junior translator's translation is \"圖3 2015年香港銀行同業利率.\" This translation is more precise, using \"銀行同業利率\" for \"interbank interest rates,\" which is a more formal and accurate term in the financial context.\n5. The fifth junior translator's translation is \"圖3 2015年香港銀行同業拆息利率.\" This translation is the most precise, using \"銀行同業拆息利率\" for \"interbank interest rates,\" which is the most accurate and formal term in the financial context.\n6. The sixth junior translator's translation is \"圖3 2015年香港美元銀行間利率.\" This translation is incorrect because \"香港美元\" is not a standard term; the correct term is \"港元\" or \"香港元.\"\nBased on the above review, the best possible translation would be \"圖3 2015年香港銀行同業拆息利率,\" as it accurately reflects the original English text and uses the most formal and precise financial terminology in Traditional Chinese.\n\n圖4 2015年港元遠期點數\n圖4 2015年港元遠期點數\n\n# 聯繫匯率制度\n\n自1983年成立以來，聯匯制度（LERS）一直運作暢順，並在過去數十年間對香港的貨幣及金融穩定作出顯著貢獻。鑑於香港經濟規模小而開放，且擔任國際金融中心的角色，聯匯制度仍然是香港最合適的匯率制度。香港特別行政區政府堅決承諾維持聯匯制度。事實上，外匯及貨幣市場的穩定進一步強化了政府承諾的公信力，公眾對港元作為支付手段及保值工具的信心持續強烈。在2015年與香港的第四條協議磋商中，國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）繼續支持聯匯制度作為香港最優惠的貨幣安排，並指出香港穩健的體制、法律及政策框架、充裕的財政儲備、靈活的市場以及良好的金融體系，是支持聯匯制度暢順運作的關鍵因素。\n\n鑑於所有翻譯均大致準確地傳達了原文意思，並正確使用了詞典中指定的翻譯，但各有細節上的差異與可改善之處。以下為具體評價與改進建議：\n1. **第一譯者**：用詞較為準確，語句流暢，但「壓力測驗結果」中「測驗」與「壓力測驗」語境不完全契合，建議使用「測試」更為合適。此外，「優化銀行業的韌性」語意清晰，但「韌性」一詞在金融語境中較常見「抗風險能力」或「韌性」均可接受。\n2. **第二譯者**：語句通順，用詞準確，特別是「壓力測驗結果」改為「壓力測試結果」更符合金融術語。但「提升銀行業的韌性」中「提升」與「優化」相比，語意稍顯單一，建議使用「優化」更貼切。\n3. **第三譯者**：與第二譯者相似，但「壓力測試結果」使用正確，語句流暢，僅「提升銀行體系的韌性」中「提升」語意略顯不足，建議改為「優化」。\n4. **第四譯者**：語句流暢，用詞準確，特別是「壓力測驗結果」改為「壓力測試結果」，並使用「抗風險能力」更符合金融語境。但「考慮到美國利率的上升」中「考慮到」語氣較弱，建議使用「鑑於」更符合原文語氣。\n5. **第五譯者**：語句通順，但「壓力測試結果」使用正確，「弱勢方面兌換保證」中「弱勢方面」語意不清，應為「弱方兌換保證」。此外，「香港港元利率」重複，應為「港元利率」。\n6. **第六譯者**：語句通順，用詞準確，特別是「壓力測試結果」與「弱方兌換保證」均正確。但「流動資金」與「流動性」語意略有差異，建議使用「流動性」更符合原文語境。\n**改進建議**：結合各譯者的優點，使用「壓力測試結果」、「優化銀行業的韌性」、「鑑於美國利率上升」、「弱方兌換保證」等語句，並確保語句流暢、語意準確。\n---\n鑑於穩健的銀行體系對聯匯制度的正常運作至關重要，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察銀行對信貸、流動性及利率風險的管理，以及壓力測試結果，並加強對銀行企業及物業相關貸款的監管工作，以優化銀行業的韌性。鑑於美國利率上升，香港金融管理局提醒公眾在風險管理方面做好必要準備，指出任何觸發弱方兌換保證及港元流出，都是港元利率正常化過程中的自然且必要步驟。\n\n為改善貨幣發行局帳戶的透明度，自1998年10月起，已將特定部分的外匯基金資產指定用以支持貨幣基礎。支持比率（定義為支持資產除以貨幣基礎）於2015年在106.3至107.5%的窄範圍內上落，沒有觸及上限或下限觸發水平。該比率於12月31日收於106.3%（圖5）。根據聯匯制度，雖然已指定特定外匯基金資產用於支持組合，但所有外匯基金資產均可得用以支持港元匯率。基金擁有龐大的財務資源，可作為強力後盾，以保護香港在突發衝擊下貨幣和金融的穩定。\n\n圖5 2015年支持比率的每日變動\n所有翻譯都正確使用了「圖」和「支持」這兩個詞彙，符合詞典要求。各版本在語法和用詞上均無明顯錯誤，但略有差異。第一、第三、第五和第六版使用「變動」，第二和第四版使用「變化」或「日變化」。在中文語境中，「變動」更常用於描述數據或比率的變化，語氣更正式且符合財務或統計圖表的語境。因此，選擇「變動」更為恰當。此外，第六版的語序「支持比率於2015年的每日變動」雖然正確，但略顯冗長，不如「2015年支持比率的每日變動」簡潔。綜合考量，最佳翻譯為「圖5 2015年支持比率的每日變動」。\n\n# 其他活動\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）貨幣發行局小組委員會監察及審視與香港貨幣及金融穩定有關的議題。2015年，該小組委員會考慮了包括全球銀行提供的國際美元貸款供應、國際上宏觀審慎措施的使用、美國加息對香港樓市的影響、基本利率的釐定公式、香港美元實際有效匯率上升的宏觀經濟影響，以及新興市場經濟體的主權風險等議題。小組委員會討論的記錄及提交給該小組委員會的貨幣發行局運作報告，載於香港金融管理局網站上。\n\n# 貨幣穩定性\n\n香港金融研究中心（HKIMR）繼續贊助貨幣政策、銀行及金融等領域的研究。2015年，該學會舉辦了16位研究員，並發表了27篇工作論文。\n\n該學會舉辦了五場國際研討會和工作坊。主要的包括：\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Correctly uses \"舉辦\" for \"organised\" and \"5\" for \"five.\" The structure is fluent and natural.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"場\" is used for \"conferences and workshops,\" which is acceptable, but \"研討會和工作坊\" is slightly redundant since \"workshops\" are often included in \"conferences.\"  \n   - \"主要的包括\" is correct but could be more concise.\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"5項\" for \"five ones,\" which is grammatically correct.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"國際會議和研討會\" is slightly off since \"conferences\" and \"workshops\" are not always the same. Also, \"主要項包括\" is awkward and unnatural.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"舉辦5場國際會議及研討會\" which is fluent and accurate.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"主要項包括\" is awkward and unnatural, similar to the second translation.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"5個\" for \"five,\" which is acceptable.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"國際會議和研討會\" is slightly redundant, and \"主要的項包括\" is awkward.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"五場國際會議及研討會\" which is natural and accurate.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"主要的包括\" is correct but could be more concise.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Uses \"五場國際研討會和工作坊\" which is accurate and natural.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"主要的包括\" is correct but could be more concise.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**  \nThe best translation should use \"五場\" for \"five\" (more natural in Chinese than \"5\"), \"國際研討會和工作坊\" to accurately reflect \"international conferences and workshops,\" and \"主要的包括\" to maintain clarity and conciseness. The structure should be natural and fluent, avoiding awkward phrasing like \"主要項包括.\"\n**Final Translation:**  \n該學會舉辦了五場國際研討會和工作坊。主要的包括：\n\n* 一月舉行的第六屆國際中國經濟會議，主題為「槓桿與金融體系效率與穩定性：中國與國際經驗」。會議呈交了11篇高質量的研究論文，涵蓋廣泛的議題，例如中國企業槓桿、中國信貸泡沫與商業週期、銀行競爭與金融穩定，以及銀行監管與信貸供應。\n* 五月舉行的香港金融研究中心與香港大學聯合會議，名為「香港金融研究中心－香港大學國際金融、機構與經濟增長會議」。會議涵蓋許多不同的經濟議題，包括銀行與貨幣政策、國際融資與跨境併購、金融監管設計，以及宏觀經濟環境與資本市場。\n* 十月舉行的香港金融研究中心、美國聯邦儲備系統理事會、歐洲中央銀行與達拉斯聯邦儲備銀行聯合會議，主題為「分歧的貨幣政策、全球資本流動與金融穩定」。會議探討了廣泛的議題，包括貨幣政策與國際資本流動及匯率的關係、分歧的貨幣政策及其對全球金融穩定的影響、主要央行政策對世界其他地區的溢出效應，以及全球政策協調的成本與效益。\n\n該學會亦於8月舉辦第13屆HKIMR暑期研討會，並於9月舉辦第13屆HKIMR中國內地經濟會議，探討中國內地財政改革及地方政府融資等議題。這些會議及研討會吸引了來自學術界、金融服務業及全球中央銀行的參加者。此外，該學會於當年舉辦了24場公開研討會，涵蓋經濟、貨幣及金融等廣泛範圍的議題。\n\n# 紙幣與硬幣\n\n2015年底，流通紙幣總值為本港360.2億元，較一年前上升5.3%（圖6、7及8）。政府發行紙幣及硬幣的總流通金額為本港11.2億元，上升2.9%（圖9及10）。政府發行的本港10元紙幣流通價值為4.0億元，其中85%為聚合物紙幣。\n"}
{"en":"# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA focused its supervisory efforts on authorized institutions risk governance, including credit and liquidity risk management systems, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing controls, and selling practices for investment and insurance products. With the build-up of systemic risks, the HKMA announced a 0.625% jurisdictional Countercyclical Capital Buffer for Hong Kong from 1 January 2016 (and 1.25% from 1 January 2017). Five authorized institutions were designated as Domestic Systemically Important Banks which will be subject to a Higher Loss Absorbency capital buffer. Significant progress was made on reforms for recovery and resolution with the introduction of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill into the Legislative Council. The HKMA also stepped up its work with the banking industry on enhancing access to basic banking services, consumer education, and the skills and knowledge development of bank directors and financial practitioners.\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# Overview\n\nAmid signs of a divergence in monetary policy stances among the major developed economies, emerging markets faced a higher risk of capital outflows and slower economic growth in 2015. In order to maintain the resilience of the banking sector against a possible abrupt deterioration in the macroeconomic environment, the HKMA continued to closely monitor the effectiveness of authorized institutions’ (AIs) risk governance and their systems for management of credit and liquidity risks.\n\n# Operational supervision\n\nIn 2015, the HKMA continued to adopt the supervisory approach where regular on-site examinations were supplemented by an increased number of thematic reviews. Thematic reviews are in-depth off-site reviews focusing on particular risk areas or specific activities of groups of selected AIs. This approach has allowed the HKMA to prioritise its supervisory resources to focus on emerging and more significant risks of AIs.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA performed a total of 193 on-site examinations. More in-depth thematic on-site examinations on credit risk management and asset quality were conducted, in view of the emerging signs of deterioration in the asset quality of AIs' loan portfolio. The HKMA increased the number of examinations on treasury related activities given market uncertainty amid the divergence of monetary policies in major advanced economies. On-site examinations were also conducted on Mainland-related business, stress testing and liquidity risk management, operational and technology risk management, capital planning, anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing (AML\/CFT) controls and internal ratings-based (IRB) models of AIs. AIs' activities in securities, investment products, insurance and Mandatory Provident Fund (MPF)-related businesses were also subject to on-site examinations by specialist teams during the year.\n\nFurthermore, a total of 152 thematic off-site reviews were conducted covering similar areas as the thematic on-site examinations. Table 1 contains details of the operational supervision work.\n\nIn 2015, 196 off-site reviews were conducted to assess AIs’ corporate governance, financial position and business operations. Supervisory attention focused on risk governance, capital planning, corporate sector credit and monitoring of implementation of Basel III standards. The supervisory teams maintained frequent contact with the boards of directors and external auditors of selected AIs. 20 tripartite meetings were held with the senior management and external auditors of AIs, while 23 meetings were held with the full board or board-level committees of selected AIs.\n\nThe Banking Supervision Review Committee considered four cases, all concerning the authorization of AIs.\n\nTo better utilise its supervisory resources to deal with competing priorities, the HKMA continued to invoke powers under section 59(2) of the Banking Ordinance to require AIs to appoint external auditors to follow up on potentially material supervisory issues. The HKMA commissioned six reports under this provision in 2015. Two of the reports covered AML\/CFT controls and another two of the reports covered private banking business, while the remaining were related to areas including securities related activities and loans classification system.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nNo AI breached the requirements of the Banking Ordinance relating to capital adequacy or liquidity ratio in 2015. There were 84 breaches under various sections of the Ordinance, but none affected the interests of depositors and they were rectified promptly by the AIs.\n\nTable 1 Operational supervision\n\n# Powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance\n\nMelli Bank Plc continues to be subject to the exercise of powers under section 52 of the Banking Ordinance. The directions imposed by the Monetary Authority on 25 June 2008 under section 52(1)(A) of the Banking Ordinance on the affairs, business and property of the Hong Kong Branch of Melli Bank Plc remained in force during the year. The HKMA will continue to communicate regularly with the relevant authorities to monitor developments related to the branch and its head office in the UK, and will keep in view the supervisory measures taken to protect the interests of the AI’s depositors.\n\n# CAMEL rating review\n\nThe CAMEL Approval Committee reviewed and determined the composite CAMEL ratings of AIs. The AIs were notified of the ratings and given the opportunity to request a review. There was no request for a review during the year.\n\n# Specialised supervisory work\n\n# Supervision of operational and technology risks\n\nThe HKMA continued to issue new or updated guidance on operational and technology risk management in the light of emerging risks and industry developments. In particular, the HKMA completed the revision of the Supervisory Policy Manual (SPM) module in relation to electronic banking (e-banking), which allows AIs more flexibility in offering new e-banking services. In addition, a circular was issued on cyber security, reiterating the importance for the boards and senior management of AIs to have oversight of effective cyber security risk management. The HKMA also published periodic issues of its “Operational Incidents Watch” highlighting the modus operandi of selected fraud cases or operational incidents and the control weaknesses identified.\n\nThe HKMA conducted risk-based thematic on-site and off-site supervisory reviews to evaluate selected AIs' operational and technology risk management at the enterprise level or in specific business lines. These covered selected areas in relation to AIs' operational risk management framework, cyber security risk management, controls for guarding against rogue trading activities, oversight of important outsourcing service providers, fraud risk management and technology controls for anti-money laundering. These supervisory reviews were supplemented by the annual independent compliance exercises covering operational risk management framework, technology risk management (including protection of customer data) and business continuity planning, where selected AIs were required to appoint independent and qualified assessors to examine the adequacy of their relevant controls and then rectify the weaknesses identified. The HKMA also identified and analysed the trend and key supervisory focus of AIs' operational and technology risks, with particular reference to the AIs that play an important role in the stability and effective functioning of Hong Kong's monetary and banking systems.\n\nThe HKMA monitored the final phase of the banking industry's implementation of the chip-based ATM technology through which AIs completed the card replacement process of pure credit cards by the end of 2015. The HKMA also required card issuing AIs to implement authentication controls to further improve the security over \"card-not-present\" credit card transactions. Separately, after receiving reports that the names of cardholders stored in some contactless credit cards could be accessed stealthily, the HKMA required the AIs concerned to take prompt action to notify and protect the affected cardholders. The HKMA devoted resources to publicise and explain the scale and implications of the incident to address public concern and to monitor AIs' remedial efforts, including the prompt replacement of affected cards.\n\nThe HKMA collaborated with the industry and other stakeholders on a number of initiatives, including public awareness programme on e-banking security precautions, establishing a platform for sharing cyber security intelligence, and providing support and advice to a crisis management exercise organised by the Hong Kong Financial Services Business Continuity Management Forum that involved AIs and other financial firms.\n\n# Supervision of wealth management and MPF-related businesses\n\nThe HKMA co-operated closely with other financial regulators in Hong Kong in providing guidance and supervising AIs’ selling of securities, investment products, insurance products and MPF schemes. Regular contact was maintained with the regulators through bilateral and multilateral meetings, as well as under the auspices of the Council of Financial Regulators. These meetings covered various issues involving financial groups or regulated entities with close business relationships across different sectors in the financial services industry to ensure more co-ordinated and effective supervisory action.\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA conducted 25 on-site and offsite thematic examinations and 15 off-site surveillance of AIs. These covered the selling of investment products, handling the settlement of securities transactions and safe custody of client securities, and the selling of non-linked long term insurance (NLTI) products and MPF-related products involving retail, private banking and corporate banking customers.\n\nIn August, the HKMA issued a circular to AIs to provide guidance on suitability assessment and product information disclosure in the selling of NLTI products to customers. The guidance aimed to assist AIs in complying with regulatory standards, including relevant requirements issued in July by the Office of the Commissioner of Insurance and the Hong Kong Federation of Insurers.\n\n# Banking Stability\n\nThe HKMA continued to work closely with the Financial Services and the Treasury Bureau (FSTB) in the legislative process for the Insurance Companies (Amendment) Bill 2014, to establish an independent Insurance Authority and a statutory licensing regime for insurance intermediaries. In July, the Insurance Companies (Amendment) ordinance 2015 was enacted by the Legislative Council, which provides, among other things, for the inspection and investigation powers, in respect of AIs’ insurance intermediary activities, of the Monetary Authority through delegation.\n\nThe HKMA processed six applications to become Registered Institutions (RIs) and one application from RIs to engage in additional regulated activities. It granted consent to 204 executive officers responsible for supervising the securities activities of RIs, and conducted background checks on 9,697 individuals whose information was submitted by RIs for inclusion in the register maintained by the HKMA.\n\n# Supervision of treasury activities\n\nAIs’ liquidity risk management remained one of the HKMA’s priority supervisory focuses, particularly in light of the anticipated normalisation of interest rates in the US and the potential subsequent reversal of fund flows that could have an impact on AIs’ liquidity positions. Throughout 2015, the HKMA continued to implement the enhanced Stable Funding Requirement for AIs to maintain sufficient stable funds to support their lending business. Since the implementation of the Basel III Liquidity Coverage Ratio (LCR) from 1 January 2015, the HKMA has been monitoring the level and trend of LCRs of category 1 institutions, which generally maintained LCRs close to or over 100%, well above the statutory minimum of 60% for 2015 under the phase-in arrangement.\n\nSeparately, the HKMA conducted thematic on-site examinations on selected AIs’ control framework for managing the risks associated with the anticipated interest rate normalisation. Amid the market volatility, the HKMA also paid close attention to abrupt market changes and their impact on the banking sector as well as individual AIs, and undertook appropriate follow-up action.\n\n# Supervisor-driven stress testing programme\n\nThe HKMA continued to conduct the bottom-up supervisor-driven stress testing programme to better understand the resilience of locally incorporated retail banks under extreme and adverse economic conditions, and to encourage them to develop plans to address potential problems in times of stress. A number of improvements were introduced during the year to collect more granular information to gain a greater insight into the risk dynamics of selected areas. The HKMA analysed the results submitted by the participating AIs and discussed with them how their stress-testing processes could be further improved.\n\n# Credit risk management and asset quality\n\n# Credit growth and asset quality\n\nThe strong credit growth trend observed in previous years has subsided since the second half of 2015. For the year as a whole, the banking sector’s total lending increased by 3.5%, compared with 12.7% in 2014 (table 2). As customer deposits grew faster than bank lending, the overall loan-to-deposit ratio decreased to 70.1% at the end of 2015 from 72.2% a year ago.","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

銀行業穩定性\n\n香港金融管理局將監管重點放在獲授權機構的風險治理上，包括信貸及流動性風險管理系統、反洗錢及反恐融資控制措施，以及投資及保險產品的銷售實踐。隨著系統性風險的積累，香港金融管理局於2016年1月1日宣布在香港實施0.625%的逆週期資本緩衝（並於2017年1月1日提高至1.25%）。五間獲授權機構被指定為系統重要性銀行，將會面對更高的損失吸收資本緩衝要求。在《金融機構（解決）條例草案》提交立法會後，有關恢復及解決機制的改革取得重大進度。香港金融管理局亦加強與銀行業界合作，以提升基本銀行服務的可及性、消費者教育，以及銀行董事及金融專業人員的技能和知識發展。\n\n# 2015年回顧\n\n# 概述\n\n在主要發達經濟體貨幣政策路向出現分歧的跡象下，新興市場在2015年面臨更高的資本外流風險及經濟增長放緩的壓力。為維持銀行業在宏觀經濟環境可能突然惡化情況下的韌性，香港金融管理局繼續密切監察認可機構（AIs）風險治理制度及其信貸及流動性風險管理系統的成效。\n\n# 運作監督\n\n2015年，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續採納監管方法，即定期現場檢查輔以增加數目的主題審查。主題審查是深入的非現場審查，聚焦於特定風險範疇或部分認可機構的特定活動。此方法容許香港金融管理局優先配置其監管資源，重點關注認可機構所面對的新興及更重大風險。\n\n在本年度內，香港金融管理局（HKMA）共進行了193次現場檢查。鑑於認可機構（AIs）貸款組合資產質素出現惡化跡象，HKMA進行了更深入的主題性現場檢查，重點為信貸風險管理及資產質素。鑑於主要先進經濟體貨幣政策的分歧導致市場不確定性增加，HKMA亦增加了對與財務相關活動的檢查數目。此外，HKMA亦對與內地相關業務、壓力測試及流動性風險管理、營運及科技風險管理、資本規劃、反洗錢及反恐融資（AML\/CFT）控制措施，以及認可機構的內部評分基礎（IRB）模型進行了現場檢查。認可機構在證券、投資產品、保險及強制性公積金（MPF）相關業務的活動，亦會面對專門小組進行的現場檢查。\n\n此外，總共進行了152項主題性的非現場審查，涵蓋與主題性現場檢查相似的範疇。表1包含運作監督工作的詳情。\n\n2015 年進行了 196 次非現場審查，以評估認可機構的公司治理、財務狀況及業務運作。監管重點集中於風險治理、資本規劃、企業部門信貸及巴塞爾 III 標準的推行情況。監管小組與部分認可機構的董事會及外部審計師保持頻繁聯繫。與認可機構的高層管理人員及外部審計師舉行了 20 次三方會議，同時與部分認可機構的董事會或董事會級委員會舉行了 23 次會議。\n\n銀行監督審查委員會考慮了四個個案，所有個案均涉及認可機構的授權。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估各個翻譯版本時，我們需關注幾個關鍵方面：語法正確性、語句流暢度、用詞準確性，以及是否符合中文表達習慣與文化語境。\n1. **第一個翻譯**使用了「認可」兩次，與原文「authorization」重複，語意重複且不自然，應避免。\n2. **第二個翻譯**用詞準確，語法正確，語句流暢，符合中文表達習慣，是目前較佳的版本。\n3. **第三個翻譯**省略了「個」字，使「4個案」語意不完整，應補上「個」字。\n4. **第四個翻譯**語法正確，但「與……有關」略顯口語化，與正式語境稍有出入。\n5. **第五個翻譯**語法正確，但「授權事宜」略顯冗長，與原文「authorization」語意稍有偏差。\n6. **第六個翻譯**語法正確，但「4個案」同樣缺少「個」字，語意不完整。\n綜合考量，第二個翻譯在語法、語意與語境上表現最佳，僅需微調「四個個案」為「四個個案」以符合中文表達習慣，並確保所有術語正確使用。最終翻譯應在語意準確、語法正確、語句流暢的基礎上，選擇最符合中文語境的表達方式。\n\n為更好利用其監管資源以處理競爭性優先事項，香港金融管理局（HKMA）繼續援引《銀行條例》第59(2)條的權力，要求認可機構委任外部審計師，以跟進潛在重大監管問題。HKMA於2015年根據此條款委託了6份報告。其中兩份報告涵蓋反洗錢／反資助恐怖主義（AML\/CFT）控制措施，另外兩份報告涵蓋私人銀行業務，其餘則涉及包括證券相關活動及貸款分類系統等範疇。\n\n# 銀行業穩定性\n\n2015年，沒有任何認可機構違反《銀行條例》有關資本充足率或流動性比率的規定。根據條例的各種條文，共有84宗違規行為，但均未影響存款人的利益，並已由認可機構迅速糾正。\n\n表1 操作監督\n\n# 根據《銀行條例》第52條賦予的權力\n\nMelli Bank Plc 繼續會面對《銀行條例》第52條所賦予的權限。2008年6月25日，香港金融管理局根據《銀行條例》第52(1)(A)條對Melli Bank Plc香港分行的事務、業務及財產所作出的指示，在當年仍然有效。香港金融管理局將繼續與有關當局保持定期溝通，以監察與該分行及其英國總行相關的發展情況，並會密切留意已採取的監管措施，以保護認可機構存款人的利益。\n\n# CAMEL 評級審查\n\nCAMEL審批委員會檢討並制定了AIs的綜合CAMEL評級。AIs已知悉評級結果，並獲得請求審查的機會。該年度內無任何審查請求。\n\n# 專門的監督工作\n\n# 營運及科技風險的監督\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# Supervision of operational and technology risks.\" The task is to translate this into fluent and natural Traditional Chinese.\nThe junior translators have provided several variations, all of which are grammatically correct and convey the general meaning of the original text. However, there are subtle differences in word choice and phrasing that affect fluency and naturalness in Traditional Chinese.\n1. **Translation 1: # 操作及科技風險的監督**  \n   - \"操作\" is a direct translation of \"operational,\" but in the context of risk management, \"營運\" is more commonly used in formal or business contexts.\n   - \"監督\" is appropriate for \"supervision.\"\n2. **Translation 2: 營運與科技風險的監督**  \n   - \"營運\" is a better choice than \"操作\" for \"operational\" in this context.\n   - \"與\" is slightly more formal than \"及,\" but both are acceptable.\n   - \"監督\" is appropriate.\n3. **Translation 3: # 營運及科技風險之監控**  \n   - \"營運\" is appropriate.\n   - \"監控\" is slightly different from \"supervision\" and may imply more of a monitoring or control function rather than oversight or supervision.\n   - \"之\" is more literary and less commonly used in modern business contexts.\n4. **Translation 4: # 監督作業與科技風險**  \n   - \"作業\" is a direct translation of \"operational,\" but it is less formal and more technical than \"營運.\"\n   -

{"en":"# International Financial Centre\n\nThe global economic and financial environment was fraught with challenges in 2015, calling for closer international collaboration and communication to maintain stability. During the year, the HKMA continued to actively participate in international and regional forums while sparing no effort in raising Hong Kong’s competitiveness as an international financial centre, including enhancing our financial infrastructure, optimising the regulatory and tax regime, and capitalising on the internationalisation of the renminbi to further develop offshore renminbi business. Hong Kong’s strong economic fundamentals and robust fiscal performance continued to be recognised by credit rating agencies with Standard & Poor’s maintaining its top-rated AAA rating for Hong Kong.\n\n# OVERVIEW\n\nThe HKMA actively contributes to international discussions on issues of significance to global and regional financial stability. In July, it assumed co-chairmanship of the Financial Stability Board Regional Consultative Group for Asia (FSB RCG(A)) for a two-year period. The group’s aim is to promote interaction between FSB members and nonmembers on policy initiatives, encourage implementation of financial reforms and facilitate the exchange of views on financial stability issues. The HKMA continued to work closely with the ASEAN+3 authorities to strengthen the operations of the ASEAN+3 Macroeconomic Research Office (AMRO) — which has been upgraded to an international organisation — to monitor and analyse regional economies and support decision-making of the Chiang Mai Initiative Multilateralisation (CMIM).\n\nDuring the year, Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi pool and bond issuance experienced some contraction due to a number of market factors. However the market continued to function orderly, and renminbi trade settlement, bank lending and foreign exchange turnover maintained steady growth. In addition, the growing renminbi business conducted in and through Hong Kong contributed to the recognition of the renminbi by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) as a freely usable currency. The iMF’s decision to include it in the Special Drawing Right (SDR) currency basket will add impetus to the internationalisation of the renminbi as well as the further development of the offshore market in Hong Kong.\n\nThe safe and efficient operation of Hong Kong's financial infrastructure and its continued development play a significant role in reinforcing the competitive edge of Hong Kong as an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub. The turnover of the renminbi payment system in Hong Kong hit new highs in 2015, while the trade repository for over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives continued to support entities to report their OTC derivatives transactions as required under the new OTC derivatives market regulatory regime, which was introduced in July.\n\nHong Kong's financial infrastructure was further enhanced by the HKMA in 2015 with new components and services, including the successful launch of the e-Cheque service in December, which means that over 150 banks are now capable of receiving and processing e-Cheques from their customers through the Internet and mobile channels. The electronic bill presentment and payment (EBPP) service, which was launched in 2013, continued to see growth in merchant participation in 2015. In July, the Central Moneymarkets Unit (CMu) launched a service under its Fund Order Routing Service to support the implementation of the Mainland - Hong Kong Mutual Recognition of Funds (MRF). And, the regulatory framework for retail payment products and services was improved with the commencement in November of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance (PSSVFO). Under the PSSVFO, the HKMA is empowered to implement a mandatory licensing regime for multi-purpose stored value facilities and perform relevant supervision and enforcement functions, as well as designating important retail payment systems to ensure their safe and efficient operation under prudential regulation.\n\n# International Financial Centre\n\n# REVIEW OF 2015\n\n# International and regional co-operation\n\nWith increased connections among global financial markets, the HKMA proactively fosters co-operation with other jurisdictions in promoting sustainable economic growth and financial system stability through international and regional forums including the FSB, the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) and the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation (APEC). The HKMA also continues to implement global financial regulatory reforms, including the recommendations of the G20, to help strengthen the resilience of the global financial system.\n\nThe HKMA became a co-chair of the FSB RCG(A) in July and hosted its ninth meeting in Hong Kong in October. The RCG(A) serves as an important platform for FSB members and non-FSB members to communicate and co-operate on financial stability issues. Senior representatives from finance ministries, central banks and financial regulators of 16 Asian jurisdictions attended the meeting to discuss risks facing the region, the implications of increasing asset management activities, misconduct risk and experience with deposit insurance schemes. The HKMA also co-chaired a workshop on macroprudential policies in Hong Kong in August. The workshop was organised by the Committee on the Global Financial System (CGFS), and attended by representatives from 18 central banks from around the world. Participants shared their experiences in macroprudential policies, focusing on the calibration and evaluation of tools, their interaction with monetary policy, and possible spillover effects. The HKMA also co-hosted a conference with the Bank of England and the IMF, featuring discussions on the challenges that central banks and other policymakers face in choosing the optimal mix of monetary, macroprudential and microprudential policies. The conference was attended by over a hundred participants, including representatives from academia, central banks and international financial institutions.\n\n# Promoting monetary and financial stability in Asia\n\nThe HKMA maintained its commitment to regional cooperative initiatives to promote financial stability in Asia and to harness the region's collective voice in international financial affairs. As a co-ordinator of the macro-surveillance work for the Monetary and Financial Stability Committee established under the Executives' Meeting of East Asia-Pacific Central Banks (EMEAP), the HKMA continued to prepare the Committee’s half-yearly Macro-Monitoring Report to assess the region’s risks and vulnerabilities and the policy implications. As Chair of the EMEAP Working Group on Payment and Settlement Systems, the HKMA worked closely with the Deputy Chair to co-ordinate the Group’s effort in sharing experiences and exchanging information on risk management, oversight, standards and best practices, and developments in domestic and cross-border payment and settlement systems. It also led the Working Group’s sub-group on cross-border co-operation and development. The HKMA hosted meetings of the EMEAP\/BIS Forum on Foreign Exchange Markets and the EMEAP Working Group on Financial Markets (WGFM) in Hong Kong in June. Attended by representatives from 17 authorities from the region and major economies, the meetings reviewed the latest developments in financial markets and financial regulatory reforms.\n\nFollowing the signing of the AMRO Agreement by Hong Kong and the ASEAN+3 authorities last year, AMRO was upgraded to an international organisation in February 2016 to support its pivotal role under the enhanced CMIM.\n\n# Hong Kong’s credit ratings\n\nThe HKMA continued to maintain close dialogue with international credit rating agencies to present a balanced assessment of Hong Kong's economic performance and fiscal strength. These efforts contributed to the affirmation of Hong Kong's credit ratings by all major credit rating agencies in 2015. Standard & Poor's affirmed its highest AAA rating for Hong Kong, reflecting the agency’s recognition of Hong Kong’s above-average growth prospects for a high-income economy, sizable fiscal reserves, consistently healthy fiscal performance and strong net external asset position. Moody’s Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also maintained Hong Kong’s ratings at Aa1 and AA+ respectively, just one notch below triple-A.\n\n# Development of Hong Kong as the offshore renminbi business centre\n\nIn 2015, market factors had an impact on Hong Kong's renminbi pool. At the end of the year, outstanding renminbi customer deposits and certificates of deposit stood at RMB 1,010 billion, as compared with RMB 1,158 billion a year ago (Chart 1). Offshore renminbi bond issuance moderated amid declining interest rates in the onshore market. As a result, issuance of renminbi bonds in Hong Kong dropped to RMB 75 billion. On the other hand, renminbi trade settlement transactions handled by banks in Hong Kong expanded by 9% to RMB 6,833 billion. The outstanding amount of renminbi bank loans also increased by 58% year-on-year to RMB 297 billion (Chart 2). Average daily turnover in the renminbi Real Time Gross Settlement (RTGS) system increased to RMB 947 billion, up 29% from 2014. At the same time, the offshore renminbi foreign exchange market saw further growth in Hong Kong, with survey results indicating a daily turnover of some US$ 93 billion equivalent at the end of April 2015, an increase of 88% from April 2013 when the last BIS Triennial Survey was conducted. Hong Kong remained the largest offshore renminbi business hub with a market of considerable depth and breadth. Another significant development reinforcing this position was the implementation of the MRF initiative in July, which has expanded Hong Kong’s renminbi product offering.\n\nThe HKMA's policy initiative to expand channels for crossborder renminbi fund flows and its joint efforts with the industry to enhance Hong Kong's renminbi financial platform continued to bear fruit. In June, the People's Bank of China (PBoC) announced that offshore renminbi business clearing banks and participating banks would be allowed to conduct repo transactions in the onshore interbank bond market and remit proceeds offshore, to facilitate renminbi liquidity management by banks in the offshore market. In September, the PBoC relaxed the rules on cross-border renminbi cash pooling, enabling more multinational corporations to conduct intra-group cash transfers under streamlined arrangements. The Mainland authorities also granted foreign central banks, international financial institutions and sovereign wealth funds wider access to the onshore interbank bond market in July. They further opened up the Mainland’s foreign exchange market to these institutions in September.\n\nOn 30 november, the IMF announced its decision to include the renminbi in the SDR currency basket with effect from 1 October 2016. The decision affirms the renminbi’s status as a freely usable currency, and further promotes confidence in the use of the renminbi for global transactions. As an international financial centre and the global offshore renminbi business hub, Hong Kong will benefit from new business opportunities arising from the further internationalisation of the renminbi and the Mainland’s enhanced connection with the global economic and financial systems.\n\nHong Kong continued to reinforce its collaboration on renminbi business with other jurisdictions throughout the year. The HKMA co-hosted the third RMB Trade and Investment Dialogue with Australia and the fifth RMB Business Forum with London, and worked with Malaysia and Thailand for the second time in facilitating private sector discussions on renminbi business. Through these initiatives, banks in Hong Kong strengthened their renminbi business flows and linkages with other markets, which will bring more renminbi business to Hong Kong. The HKMA also stepped up its marketing efforts to promote the wider use of renminbi in trade, investment and financing among corporations and institutions through participation in industry events in Hong Kong and in overseas markets including Canada, Japan and Africa.\n\nDeputy Chief Executive of the HKMA, Mr Eddie Yue, speaks at a seminar during the fifth meeting of Hong Kong–London RMB Forum on 11 December 2015.\n\n# CEPA\n\nA new agreement to achieve basic liberalisation of trade in services between Mainland China and Hong Kong was signed in November under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA). The agreement extends most of the pilot liberalisation measures introduced in Guangdong in 2014 nationwide. By according national treatment, in principle, to Hong Kong banks, the new agreement is expected to provide these banks with more policy certainty and greater flexibility when conducting business in Mainland China.\n\n# Training\n\nThe HKMA continued to provide training programmes for officials from the PBoC, the State Administration of Foreign Exchange and the China Banking Regulatory Commission. In addition to programmes dealing with central banking and general risk management, topics included consumer protection, credit reference, monetary and collateral management, financial soundness indicators analysis, and systemic risk monitoring. Ad hoc training sessions were also conducted for delegations from overseas banking and law enforcement agencies.\n\n# Government Bond Programme\n\nDuring the year, the HKMA arranged eight tenders of institutional government bonds amounting to HK$ 20.4 billion. By the end of 2015, the total amount of outstanding institutional bonds was HK$ 68.9 billion.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

國際金融中心\n\n2015年全球經濟及金融環境充滿挑戰，需要更緊密的國際合作與溝通以維持穩定。當年，香港金融管理局繼續積極參與國際及區域會議，並不遺餘力加強香港作為國際金融中心的競爭力，包括加強金融基礎設施、優化監管及稅務制度，並善用人民幣國際化以進一步發展離岸人民幣業務。香港強勁的經濟基本面及穩健的財政表現持續獲得信用評級機構認可，標準普爾亦維持其對香港的頂級AAA評級。\n\n# 概述\n\n香港金融管理局積極參與國際有關全球及區域金融穩定的重要議題討論。7月，香港金融管理局擔任亞洲金融穩定理事會區域諮詢小組（FSB RCG(A)）共同主席，任期為兩年。該小組旨在促進金融穩定理事會成員與非成員之間在政策措施上的互動，鼓勵推行金融改革，並增進有關金融穩定議題的意見交流。香港金融管理局繼續與東盟加三（ASEAN+3）當局密切合作，強化東盟加三宏觀經濟研究辦公室（AMRO）的運作，該辦公室已升格為國際組織，負責監察及分析區域經濟，並支持清邁倡議多邊化（CMIM）的決策。\n\n在這六份翻譯中，各有其優點與不足。整體而言，翻譯的語法與用詞大致正確，但部分句子結構略顯生硬，影響了語感與流暢度。以下為具體評析：\n1. **第一份翻譯**：語句通順，用詞準確，特別是對「貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易量則維持穩定增長」的處理較為自然。然而，「認定其為自由使用的貨幣」語氣略顯強硬，與原文語氣稍有出入。\n2. **第二份翻譯**：語句較為簡潔，但「受到數目市場因素的收縮」語意不清，應為「因數目市場因素而收縮」。此外，「將其視為可自由使用的貨幣」語氣與原文略有差異。\n3. **第三份翻譯**：整體語句流暢，但保留了「turnover」的英文，應翻譯為「交易量」或「交易額」。此外，「國際貨幣基金組織對人民幣作為可自由使用的貨幣的肯定」語序略顯冗長。\n4. **第四份翻譯**：語句通順，用詞準確，特別是「增添動力」一詞與原文「add impetus」契合。然而，「人民幣結算」語意不完整，應為「人民幣貿易結算」。\n5. **第五份翻譯**：語句流暢，用詞準確，特別是「持續穩定增長」與「推動人民幣國際化」的處理較為自然。然而，「將其納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子」語序略顯生硬。\n6. **第六份翻譯**：存在明顯的錯誤，如「外匯 कारोबार」與「viznano」等非中文字詞，應排除。此外，「國際貨幣基金組織（國際貨幣基金組織）」重複，應修正。\n**改進方向**：需確保語句流暢、語意準確，並正確使用詞彙與語序。特別是對「貿易結算」、「交易量」、「肯定」、「納入」等關鍵詞的處理，應與原文語氣一致，並符合中文表達習慣。\n---\n在這一年中，香港的離岸人民幣資金池及債券發行因多項市場因素而有所收縮。然而，市場仍有序運作，人民幣貿易結算、銀行貸款及外匯交易量維持穩定增長。此外，日益增長的人民幣業務在香港進行及透過香港進行，促進了國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）對人民幣的肯定，認定其為自由使用的貨幣。IMF決定將其納入特別提款權（SDR）貨幣籃子，將進一步推動人民幣國際化進程，以及香港離岸市場的發展。\n\n香港金融基礎設施的安全及高效運作及其持續發展，在強化香港作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐的競爭優勢方面發揮重要作用。2015年，香港人民幣支付系統的交易額創下新高，同時，場外衍生工具交易報告庫繼續支持實體根據新推出的場外衍生工具市場監管制度的規定，提交其場外衍生工具交易報告，該制度於7月推出。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2015年進一步增強香港的金融基礎設施，新增多項組成部分及服務，包括於12月成功推出電子支票服務，這意味著目前已有超過150間銀行可透過互聯網及流動渠道為客戶收取及處理電子支票。電子帳單及繳費（EBPP）服務於2013年推出，至2015年其商戶參與度持續增加。7月，中央貨幣市場單位（CMU）在其資金訂單路由服務下推出一項服務，以支持內地與香港互認基金（MRF）的推行。此外，零售支付產品及服務的監管框架亦於11月《支付系統及儲值支付工具條例》（PSSVFO）的實施後得到優化。根據《PSSVFO》，香港金融管理局獲賦予權力，可落實對多用途儲值支付工具的強制發牌制度，並執行相關監管及執法功能，同時指定重要的零售支付系統，以確保其在審慎監管下安全及高效運作。\n\n# 國際金融中心\n\n# 回顧2015年\n\n# 國際與區域合作\n\n隨著全球金融市場聯繫增加，香港金融管理局積極透過國際及區域會議，包括金融穩定理事會（FSB）、國際清算銀行（BIS）及亞太經濟合作組織（APEC），促進與其他司法管轄區的合作，以助發展可持續的經濟增長及金融體系穩定。香港金融管理局亦繼續落實全球金融監管改革，包括二十國集團（G20）的建議，以強化全球金融體系的韌性。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於7月成為金融穩定理事會（FSB）RCG(A)的共同主席，並於10月在香港舉辦其第九次會議。RCG(A)擔當重要平台，讓FSB成員與非成員就金融穩定事宜進行溝通與合作。來自16個亞洲管轄區的財政部、中央銀行及金融監管機構的高層代表參加了會議，討論地區面臨的風險、日益增加的資產管理活動的影響、不當行為風險及存款保險計劃的經驗。HKMA亦於8月共同擔任主席舉辦一場關於香港宏觀審慎政策的工作坊。該工作坊由全球金融體系委員會（CGFS）舉辦，並有來自全球18個中央銀行的代表參與。與會者分享了他們在宏觀審慎政策方面的經驗，重點包括工具的校準與評估、與貨幣政策的互動，以及可能的溢出效應。HKMA亦與英倫銀行及國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）共同舉辦了一場會議，探討央行及其他政策制定者在選擇最佳貨幣、宏觀審慎及微觀審慎政策組合時所面臨的挑戰。該會議吸引了超過一百名參加者，包括來自學術界、中央銀行及國際金融機構的代表。\n\n# 促進亞洲貨幣及金融穩定\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估這些翻譯時，首先需注意「promoting」一詞在詞典中對應的翻譯為「以助發展」，所有翻譯均正確使用了該詞。然而，翻譯的整體語感、語序與語法結構仍有改進空間。\n1. **第一個翻譯**「以助發展亞洲貨幣及金融穩定」語序自然，但「以助發展」與後文搭配略顯生硬，語意上稍顯不完整，未能完全傳達「promoting」的主動促進之意。\n2. **第二個翻譯**「# 以助發展亞洲的貨幣與金融穩定」語法正確，但標點符號使用不一致（# 號），且「與」字雖可接受，但「及」字更符合正式文體。\n3. **第三個翻譯**「以助發展亞洲的貨幣與金融穩定」語序與語法正確，但與原文相比，語意稍顯平淡，缺乏強調促進的主動性。\n4. **第四個翻譯**「# 以助發展貨幣及金融穩定於亞洲」語序不自然，「於亞洲」的語法結構與中文習慣不符，應調整語序。\n5. **第五個翻譯**「#以助發展亞洲的貨幣及金融穩定」語法正確，但標點符號使用不一致（# 號），且語意與原文略有出入。\n6. **第六個翻譯**「# 以助發展亞洲貨幣與金融穩定性」使用了「穩定性」一詞，與原文「stability」語意相符，但「穩定性」在中文中較少用於金融政策語境，「穩定」更為常見。\n**改進方向：**  \n- 確保語序自然，符合中文語法習慣。\n- 使用「及」字而非「與」字，更符合正式文體。\n- 避免使用不常見的詞彙如「穩定性」。\n- 確保標點符號使用正確，避免不必要的符號如「#」。\n**最佳翻譯：**  \n# 促進亞洲貨幣及金融穩定\n\n香港金融管理局維持其對區域合作措施的承諾，以促進亞洲金融穩定，並發揮地區在國際金融事務中的集體聲音。作為東亞太平洋中央銀行管理層會議（EMEAP）下設的貨幣與金融穩定委員會的宏觀監察工作協調機構，香港金融管理局繼續準備該委員會的半年度宏觀監察報告，以評估地區的風險與不穩定因素及其政策影響。作為EMEAP支付與結算系統工作小組的主席，香港金融管理局與副主席密切合作，協調小組在風險管理、監督、標準及最佳實踐，以及國內和跨境支付與結算系統發展方面的經驗交流與資訊分享工作。香港金融管理局亦領導該工作小組的跨境合作與發展分組。香港金融管理局於6月在香港舉辦EMEAP與國際結算銀行（BIS）外匯市場論壇及EMEAP金融市場工作小組（WGFM）的會議。會議由來自地區及主要經濟體的17個機構代表參加，檢討金融市場的最新發展及金融監管改革。\n\n繼香港與東盟+3當局去年簽訂AMRO協議後，AMRO於2016年2月升格為國際組織，以支持其在加強後的清邁倡議多邊化中的關鍵角色。\n\n# 香港的信貸評級\n\n香港金融管理局繼續與國際信用評級機構保持密切對話，以對香港的經濟表現和財政實力作出平衡評估。這些努力促進了2015年所有主要信用評級機構對香港信用評級的肯定。標準普爾維持對香港的最高AAA評級，反映該機構對香港作為高收入經濟體擁有高於平均水平的增長展望、龐大的財政儲備、持續健康的財政表現以及強勁的淨外資產地位的認可。穆迪投資者服務公司和惠譽評級亦分別維持香港的評級為Aa1和AA+，僅比三A級低一級別。\n\n# 香港發展為離岸人民幣業務中心的進程\n\n2015年，市場因素對香港人民幣資金池產生影響。年底時，人民幣客戶存款及存款憑證餘額達人民幣1,010億元，較一年前的人民幣1,158億元有所下降（圖1）。在境內市場利率下跌的背景下，離岸人民幣債券發行放緩。結果，香港人民幣債券發行額下降至人民幣750億元。另一方面，香港銀行處理的人民幣貿易結算交易擴大9%，達到人民幣6,833億元。人民幣銀行貸款餘額亦同比增加58%，達人民幣297億元（圖2）。人民幣即時全額結算（RTGS）系統的平均每日交易額增至人民幣947億元，較2014年上升29%。同時，香港離岸人民幣外匯市場進一步增長，調查結果顯示，2015年4月底每日交易額達約930億美元等值，較2013年4月進行的上一次BIS三年期調查時上升88%。香港仍然為全球最大離岸人民幣業務中心，市場具備相當的深度與廣度。另一項強化此地位的重要發展是2015年7月推行的MRF計劃，該計劃擴大了香港的人民幣產品種類。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）擴大跨境人民幣資金流渠道的政策倡議，以及與業界共同推動香港人民幣金融平台優化的措施，持續取得成果。6月，中國人民銀行（PBoC）宣布，離岸人民幣業務清算銀行及參與銀行將被容許在境內銀行間債券市場進行回購交易，並將所得資金匯往境外，以增進銀行在離岸市場的人民幣流動性管理。9月，PBoC放寬跨境人民幣現金池的規則，使更多跨國公司可在簡化安排下進行集團內現金轉移。7月，內地當局亦授予外國中央銀行、國際金融機構及主權財富基金較廣泛的准入權，以參與境內銀行間債券市場。他們進一步在9月開放內地外匯市場予這些機構。\n\n2015 年 11 月 30 日，國際貨幣基金組織宣布決定，自 2016 年 10 月 1 日起將人民幣納入特別提款權貨幣籃子。此決定肯定了人民幣作為自由使用的貨幣的地位，並進一步推動國際社會對人民幣在國際交易中使用的信心。作為國際金融中心及全球離岸人民幣業務樞紐，香港將從人民幣進一步國際化，以及內地與全球經濟金融體系聯繫增強所帶來的新商機中受惠。\n\n香港全年繼續加強與其他司法管轄區在人民幣業務方面的合作。香港金融管理局與澳洲共同舉辦第三屆人民幣貿易與投資對話，與倫敦共同舉辦第五屆人民幣業務論壇，並與馬來西亞及泰國第二次合作，促進私人部門就人民幣業務進行討論。透過這些措施，香港銀行加強了與其他市場在人民幣業務方面的業務流動及聯網，這將為香港帶來更多人民幣業務。香港金融管理局亦加強其市場推廣工作，透過參與香港及海外市場包括加拿大、日本及非洲的行業活動，促進公司及機構在貿易、投資及融資方面較廣泛使用人民幣。\n\n香港金融管理局副總裁葉奕雄先生於2015年12月11日在香港與倫敦人民幣論壇第五次會議期間，在一個研討會上發言。\n\n# 更緊密經貿關係安排\n\n在評估六位初級翻譯的譯文時，我們可以觀察到幾個共同的優點與問題。首先，所有譯文都正確使用了詞典中指定的詞彙，如「提供」、「11 月」、「進行」、「較大」、「經濟」、「達到」、「安排」、「根據」、「廣東」、「提交」、「大部分」，這一點值得肯定。\n然而，譯文在語法、流暢度與語境適切性方面存在差異。例如，第一譯文語句結構清晰，用詞準確，但「根據新協議，原則上給予香港銀行國民待遇」這句語序略顯生硬。第二譯文雖然語意完整，但「透過根據國民待遇原則」語法重複，顯得不自然。第三譯文語句流暢，但「根據原則對香港銀行給予國民待遇」語序略顯混亂。第四譯文使用了「提交」一詞，與原文「introduced」語意不符，應為「推出」或「實施」。第五譯文使用了「實質上給予國民待遇」，與原文「according national treatment」語意不完全一致。第六譯文整體語句流暢，語法正確，但「在《更緊密經貿合作安排》（CEPA）框架下」與原文「under the framework of the Closer Economic Partnership Arrangement (CEPA)」語序略有出入。\n綜合考量後，最佳的翻譯應當語句流暢、語法正確、語境適切，並正確使用詞典中指定的詞彙。因此，我們可以根據上述評估，產生一個更優質的譯文。\n中國內地與香港之間於11月在《更緊密經貿合作安排》（CEPA）框架下簽署一項新協議，以實現服務貿易的基本自由化。該協議將2014年廣東試點自由化措施中的大部分擴展至全國範圍。根據新協議，原則上給予香港銀行國民待遇，預計將為這些銀行在內地從事業務時提供更多政策確定性與較大靈活性。\n\n# 訓練\n\n香港金融管理局繼續為中國人民銀行、國家外匯管理局及中國銀行保險監督管理委員會的官員提供培訓課程。此外，除了涉及中央銀行及一般風險管理的課程外，主題還包括消費者保護、信貸參考、貨幣及擔保品管理、財務健全指標分析以及系統性風險監測。亦為來自海外銀行及執法機構的代表團進行臨時培訓課程。\n\n# 政府債券計劃\n\n在該年度內，香港金融管理局安排了八次機構政府債券投標，總金額為204億港元。截至2015年底，未償還的機構債券總金額為689億港元。\n"}
{"en":"# Reserves Management\n\n2015 was a turbulent year for the global financial markets, presenting unprecedented challenges to investment funds. Amid such challenging and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an overall investment return of -0.6% in 2015, but its loss was relatively mild as compared with major market indices and comparable investment funds, thanks to a series of defensive moves deployed by the HKMA over the past years which have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund.\n\n# THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\nThe Exchange Fund’s primary objective, as laid down in the Exchange Fund Ordinance, is to affect, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong. The Fund may also be used to maintain the stability and integrity of Hong Kong’s monetary and financial systems to help maintain Hong Kong as an international financial centre. The Exchange Fund is under the control of the Financial Secretary and may be invested in any securities or other assets he considers appropriate, after consulting the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC).\n\n# MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# Investment objectives and portfolio structure\n\nEFAC has set the following investment objectives for the Exchange Fund:\n\n(a) to preserve capital;\n(b) to ensure that the entire Monetary Base, at all times, will be fully backed by highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets;\n(c) to ensure that sufficient liquidity will be available for the purposes of maintaining monetary and financial stability; and\n(d) subject to (a) — (c), to achieve an investment return that will help preserve the long-term purchasing power of the Fund.\n\nThese objectives take full account of the statutory purposes of the Exchange Fund, and are incorporated into the portfolio structure and the target asset mix of the Fund.\n\nBroadly speaking, the Exchange Fund has two major portfolios — the Backing Portfolio and the Investment Portfolio. The Backing Portfolio holds highly liquid US dollar-denominated assets to provide full backing to the Monetary Base as required under the Currency Board arrangements. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development to preserve the value and long-term purchasing power of the assets. The long-term target bond-to-equity mix for the two portfolios as a whole is 72:28. In terms of target currency mix, 81% of the assets are allocated to the US dollar and the Hong Kong dollar, and the remaining 19% to other currencies.\n\nTo better manage risks and enhance returns in the medium and long term, the HKMA has been diversifying part of the Exchange Fund’s investment, in a prudent and incremental manner, into a greater variety of asset classes, including emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities, private equity and overseas investment properties. Emerging market and Mainland bonds and equities are held under the Investment Portfolio while private equity and real estate investments are held under the Long-Term Growth Portfolio (LTGP). The cap for the net asset value of the HKMA’s investments under the LTGP is maintained at one-third of the Accumulated Surplus of the Exchange Fund. At the end of 2015, the market value of investments under the LTGP totalled HK$142.1 billion, made up of HK$91.3 billion in private equity and HK$50.8 billion in real estate, with outstanding investment commitments amounted to HK$122.4 billion.\n\nThe Strategic Portfolio, established in 2007 to hold shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited that were acquired by the Government for the account of the Exchange Fund for strategic purposes, is not included in the assessment of the Fund’s investment performance because of the unique nature of this Portfolio.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The investment process\n\nThe investment process of the Exchange Fund is underpinned by decisions on two types of asset allocation — the strategic asset allocation and the tactical asset allocation. The strategic asset allocation, reflected in the investment benchmark, represents the long-term optimal asset allocation given the investment objectives of the Exchange Fund. Guided by the strategic allocation, assets are tactically allocated in an attempt to achieve an excess return over the benchmark. This often means the actual allocation is different from the benchmark, or strategic, allocation. The differences between the actual and the benchmark allocations are known as “tactical deviations”. While the benchmark and the limits for tactical deviations are determined by the Financial Secretary in consultation with EFAC, tactical decisions are made by the HKMA under delegated authority. Within the limits allowed for tactical deviations, portfolio managers may take positions to take advantage of short-term market movements.\n\n# Investment management\n\n# Direct investment\n\nHKMA staff in the Reserves Management Department directly manage the investment of about 76% of the Exchange Fund, which includes the entire Backing Portfolio and part of the Investment Portfolio. This part of the Investment Portfolio includes a set of portfolios invested in global fixed-income markets and various derivative overlay portfolios implementing macro risk management strategies for the Fund.\n\n# Use of external managers\n\nIn addition to managing assets internally, the HKMA employs external fund managers based in a number of international financial centres to manage about 24% of the Exchange Fund's assets, including all of its listed equity portfolios and other specialised assets. The purpose of appointing external managers is to tap the best investment expertise available in the market to capture a diverse mix of investment styles, and transfer knowledge and information from the market to in-house professionals.\n\nExpenditure relating to the use of external managers includes fund management and custodian fees, transaction costs, and withholding and other taxes. The expenditure is primarily determined by market factors, and may fluctuate from year to year.\n\n# Risk management and compliance\n\nThe high volatility of the financial markets in recent years has highlighted the importance of risk management. Stringent controls and investment guidelines have been established for both internally and externally managed portfolios, and compliance with guidelines and regulations is closely monitored. Risk-control tools are deployed to assess market risks under both normal and adverse market conditions. The HKMA also conducts detailed performance attribution analyses to make the best use of the investment skills of both internal and external managers.\n\n# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\n\n# The financial markets in 2015\n\nThe global financial markets were highly volatile in 2015. The equity markets, in particular, encountered exceptional turbulence. Major equity markets reached new highs in the first half of the year. However, market sentiment worsened drastically in the third quarter, arising from Mainland China growth concerns, with major equity markets reversing their year-to-date gains and registering significant quarterly losses. Global equity markets recovered somewhat along with improving market sentiment thereafter, but they worsened again towards the end of the year. With their close linkage with the Mainland economy, Hong Kong equities underperformed other major equity markets in 2015.\n\nOn sovereign bond markets, longer-term US Treasury yields rose moderately in 2015 despite expectation of US interest rate normalisation and the start of the US interest rate up-cycle, as positive sentiment was checked by concerns over global economic growth, lingering global disinflationary pressures and intensified geopolitical tensions. On the other hand, short-term European government bond yields declined and some even slipped into negative territory on the back of the European Central Bank’s aggressive monetary easing policy.\n\nOn currency markets, the US dollar continued to strengthen in 2015 with the US dollar index surging by almost 10%, amid expectation of the commencement of the US policy rate normalisation. The euro weakened significantly in the first quarter, posting the biggest single-quarter fall in the history of the euro since 1999, as the European Central Bank announced quantitative easing measures in January. On the other hand, the yen stayed largely flat against the US dollar in 2015.\n\nThe performance of major currency, bond and equity markets in 2015 is shown in Table 1.\n\n# Reserves Management\n\n# The Exchange Fund’s performance\n\nAgainst the backdrop of exceptionally volatile financial markets and difficult investment environment, the Exchange Fund recorded an investment loss of HK$15.8 billion in 2015, comprising gains of HK$7.1 billion on overseas equities, losses of HK$5 billion on Hong Kong equities, gains of HK$15.9 billion on bonds, a negative currency translation effect of HK$44.9 billion on non-Hong Kong dollar assets and gains of HK$11.1 billion on other investments held by the investment holding subsidiaries of the Fund. The negative currency translation effect was unavoidable when translating the Exchange Fund’s non-US dollar investments into Hong Kong dollar amid the sharp strengthening of the US dollar last year. Separately, the Strategic Portfolio recorded a valuation gain of HK$2.2 billion.\n\nThe total assets of the Exchange Fund reached HK$3,422.9 billion at the end of 2015. The investment return of the Exchange Fund (excluding the Strategic Portfolio) in 2015 was -0.6%. That notwithstanding, the Exchange Fund’s loss could be considered mild when compared with the underperforming major market indices and the investment fund community in general. In anticipation of a worsening investment environment, the HKMA has deployed a series of defensive moves over the past years, which include shortening the duration of bond portfolios, increasing cash holdings, and significantly reducing non-US dollar assets. We have also quickened the pace of investment diversification, especially through investments under the LTGP. These moves have enhanced the resilience of the Exchange Fund and helped mitigate some potential losses.\n\nThe annual return of the Fund from 1994 to 2015 is set out in Chart 1. Table 2 shows the 2015 investment return and the average investment returns of the Fund over a number of different time horizons. The average return was 1.2% over the past three years, 1.8% over the past five years, 3.3% over the past 10 years and 5.0% since 1994. Table 3 shows the currency mix of the Fund's assets on 31 December 2015.\n\nChart 1 Investment return of the Exchange Fund (1994 – 2015) \n1 investment return calculation excludes the holdings in the Strategic Portfolio. \n2 Composite Consumer price index is calculated based on the 2009\/2010-based

備付金管理\n\n2015年對全球金融市場而言是動盪的一年，為投資基金帶來前所未見的挑戰。在如此艱鉅嚴苛且困難的投資環境下，發行基金在2015年錄得整體投資回報為-0.6%，但其虧損相對溫和，對比主要市場指數及可比較的投資基金而言。這歸功於香港金融管理局在過去數年所部署的一系列防禦性措施，這些措施增強了發行基金的韌性。\n\n# 交易所基金\n\n根據《外匯基金條例》訂明，外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以應付香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌管，經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可將基金投資於他認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率，這一點在《外匯基金條例》中已有明確規定。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以應付香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌管，經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可將基金投資於他認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n外匯基金的首要目的是直接或間接影響香港貨幣的匯率，這一點在《外匯基金條例》中已有明確規定。基金亦可用於維持香港貨幣及金融體系的穩定與健全，以應付香港作為國際金融中心的地位。外匯基金由財政司司長掌管，經諮詢外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）後，可將基金投資於他認為適當的任何證券或其他資產。\n\n# 管理外匯基金\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English title is **\"MANAGEMENT OF THE EXCHANGE FUND\"**, and the goal is to translate it into fluent and natural Traditional Chinese. The dictionary is empty, so no specific terms need to be translated using predefined equivalents. However, the junior translators have attempted various translations, and a critical evaluation is necessary.\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator: # 基金管理**  \n   - **Strengths:** Concise and grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Too generic. \"基金管理\" simply means \"Fund Management\" and does not specify the type of fund, which is crucial in the context of \"Exchange Fund.\"\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator: # 外匯基金的管理**  \n   - **Strengths:** Accurately conveys the meaning of \"Exchange Fund Management.\" The phrase \"外匯基金\" is a direct and appropriate translation of \"Exchange Fund.\"  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The structure \"的管理\" is slightly wordy and less commonly used in formal titles. A more concise structure would be preferable.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator: # 交易所基金的管理**  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"交易所基金\" translates to \"Exchange-Traded Fund\" (ETF), which is a different concept from \"Exchange Fund.\" This is a misinterpretation of the original term.\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator: # 結匯基金管理**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the term \"結匯\" which is related to foreign exchange.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"結匯\" refers to the act of converting foreign currency into local currency, not the fund itself. This is a contextual misinterpretation.\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator: # 財政儲備基金管理**  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** \"財政儲備基金\" translates to \"Fiscal Reserve Fund,\" which is not equivalent to \"Exchange Fund.\" This is a conceptual mismatch.\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator: # 管理外匯基金**  \n   - **Strengths:** Grammatically correct and concise. The structure \"管理外匯基金\" is a natural and commonly used phrase in formal contexts.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** None significant. This is a strong candidate for the best translation.\n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**\nAmong the options, **# 管理外匯基金** is the most accurate and natural translation. It uses the correct term \"外匯基金\" for \"Exchange Fund\" and places the verb \"管理\" (management) before the noun, which is a common and formal structure in Chinese titles. It is concise, grammatically correct, and contextually appropriate. The other translations either misinterpret the term or use overly generic or awkward phrasing. Therefore, **# 管理外匯基金** is the best choice.\n\n# 投資目標與投資組合結構\n\n外匯基金諮詢委員會已為外匯基金制定以下投資目標：\n\n(a) 保障資本；  \n(b) 確保整體貨幣基礎在任何時候均能全面由流通性極高的美國美元計價資產作為後盾；  \n(c) 確保有充足流動性可得，以應付維持貨幣及金融穩定之目的；以及  \n(d) 在符合(a)至(c)的前提下，達到投資回報，以幫助維持基金的長期購買力。\n\n這些目標採用十足考慮交易所基金的法定目的，並納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置中。\n以下是對各個翻譯版本的評審與分析：\n1. **第一個翻譯**：語法上有些不自然，「採用十足考慮」的搭配不常見，且「Exchange Fund」直接保留英文，未翻譯為「交易所基金」或「外匯基金」，影響專業性。\n2. **第二個翻譯**：用詞較為自然，「交易基金」雖不完全準確，但接近「Exchange Fund」的常見翻譯；「融入」一詞較為生動，但「投資組合架構」與「目標資產配置」的搭配較為專業。\n3. **第三個翻譯**：使用「充分考慮」替換「take full account of」，雖然語意相近，但與「十足」相比，語氣稍弱；「基金」重複使用，略顯累贅。\n4. **第四個翻譯**：正確使用「採用十足考慮」，並翻譯「Exchange Fund」為「交易所基金」，語法通順，但「目標資產組合」與「投資組合結構」的搭配略顯重複。\n5. **第五個翻譯**：使用「外匯基金」翻譯「Exchange Fund」，較符合金融領域的常用術語；「納入」一詞較為正式，整體語句流暢。\n6. **第六個翻譯**：與第四個翻譯相似，但使用「已納入」，語氣更強調動作已完成，語意更明確。\n**總結與改進方向**：最佳翻譯應使用「採用十足考慮」以符合字典要求，並正確翻譯「Exchange Fund」為「交易所基金」或「外匯基金」，語句需流暢自然，避免重複用詞，並確保專業性與語意準確。\n因此，最終翻譯為：\n這些目標採用十足考慮交易所基金的法定目的，並納入基金的投資組合結構及目標資產配置中。\n\n大致而言，外匯基金擁有兩大主要組合——支持組合及投資組合。支持組合持有流通性極高的美元計價資產，以根據貨幣局制度的規定，為貨幣基礎提供十足支持。投資組合則主要投資於經濟合作及發展組織成員國的債券及股票市場，以保障資產價值及長期購買力。兩大組合整體的長期目標債券與股票比例為72:28。就目標貨幣組合而言，81%的資產配置於美元及港元，其餘19%配置於其他貨幣。\n\n為更好地管理風險及優化中長期回報，香港金融管理局（HKMA）一直以謹慎及循序漸進的方式，將外匯基金投資組合的一部分分散投資於更多元化的資產類別，包括新興市場及內地債券和股票、私募股權及海外投資物業。新興市場及內地債券和股票由投資組合持有，而私募股權及房地產投資則由長期增長組合（LTGP）持有。HKMA在LTGP下的投資淨資產價值上限維持於外匯基金累積結餘的三分之一。截至2015年底，LTGP下投資的市值總計為1,421億港元，包括913億港元的私募股權及508億港元的房地產投資，未償還的投資承諾金額為1,224億港元。\n\n策略性投資組合於2007年設立，用以持有香港交易及結算所有限公司的股份，該等股份是由政府為交易所基金的策略性目的而收購。由於此投資組合的性質獨特，因此未納入基金投資表現的評估範圍內。\n\n# 備付金管理\n\n# 投資流程\n# 投資流程\n\n外匯基金的投資過程分別以兩種資產分配的決定為基礎——策略性資產分配和戰略性資產分配。策略性資產分配反映在投資基準中，顯示鑑於外匯基金的投資目標所制定的長期最佳資產配置。在策略性分配的指引下，資產會戰略性地進行配置，以爭取超越基準的額外回報。這通常意思是實際分配與基準或策略性分配有所不同。實際分配與基準分配之間的差異稱為「戰略性偏離」。雖然基準和戰略性偏離的限制是由財政司長與外匯基金諮詢委員會磋商後制定，但戰略性決策則是由香港金融管理局在授權下作出。在容許戰略性偏離的範圍內，組合經理可採用立場以利用短期市場走勢來獲利。\n\n# 投資管理\n\n# 直接投資\n\n香港金融管理局儲備管理部門的員工直接管理約76%的外匯基金投資，其中包括整體支持組合及投資組合的一部分。這部分投資組合包括投資於全球固定收益市場的一系列組合，以及實施宏觀風險管理策略的各種衍生工具覆蓋組合。\n\n# 使用外部經理人\n\n除了內部管理資產外，香港金融管理局還聘請設於多個國際金融中心的外部基金管理機構，管理約24%的儲備基金資產，包括其全部上市股本投資組合及其他專業資產。聘請外部管理機構的目的是運用市場上可得的最優惠投資專業技術，以捕捉多元化投資形式的組合，並將市場的知識和資訊轉移給內部專業人員。\n\n與使用外部管理人有關的支出包括基金管理費用、托管費用、交易成本，以及預扣稅和其他稅項。該支出主要由市場因素所制定，且可能每年不同。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n各譯文整體上已能準確傳達原文意思，但在語法、用詞及語感上仍有改進空間。以下為具體評析：\n1. **第一譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，如「預扣稅和其他稅項」、「市場因素制定」、「每年可能有所不同」皆符合語境。唯一可優化之處為「制定」一詞，雖符合字典中「determined」的翻譯，但「由市場因素制定」語感略顯生硬，可改為「由市場因素所決定」更自然。\n2. **第二譯文**：「可不同於每年」語序不自然，應調整為「每年可能不同」。此外，「保管費」與「托管費用」語意相近，但「托管費用」更符合金融語境。\n3. **第三譯文**：「外聘經理」與「外部管理人」語意略有差異，「外聘」強調聘請行為，而原文僅指「外部管理人」，因此「外部管理人」更貼切。此外，「年年」語感較為口語，「每年」更正式。\n4. **第四譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，「交易費用」與「交易成本」語意相近，但「交易成本」更符合原文語境。此外，「且可每年不同」語感自然，但「所制定」語序略顯生硬，可調整為「所決定」。\n5. **第五譯文**：語句通順，用詞準確，「基金管理費用和托管費用」語意清晰，但「可能每年不同」語感略顯口語，可調整為「且可能每年不同」更正式。\n6. **第六譯文**：「稅務」一詞語意較為籠統，與「稅項」相比，「稅項」更符合金融語境。此外，「可每年不同」語感自然，但「所制定」語序略顯生硬。\n**改進方向：**\n- 確保「determined」翻譯為「決定」而非「制定」，語感更自然。\n- 使用「托管費用」而非「保管費」，更符合金融語境。\n- 使用「每年」而非「年年」，語感更正式。\n- 調整語序，使句子更符合中文語法習慣，如「由市場因素所決定」。\n**最佳翻譯：**\n與使用外部管理人有關的支出包括基金管理費用、托管費用、交易成本，以及預扣稅和其他稅項。該支出主要由市場因素所決定，且可能每年不同。\n\n# 風險管理與合規性\n風險管理與合規\n風險管理與合規\n# 風險管理與合規\n風險管理與合規\n風險管理與合規\n所有翻譯都正確地將 \"risk management and compliance\" 翻譯為 \"風險管理與合規\" 或 \"風險管理與合規性\"。其中 \"合規性\" 更強調 \"compliance\" 的性質或狀態，而 \"合規\" 則更偏向於動詞或行為。在專業領域中，\"合規\" 更常見於 \"合規管理\" 或 \"合規要求\" 等語境，而 \"合規性\" 則更常用於描述某種狀態或特性。\n在這段標題中，\"compliance\" 更偏向於一種制度或行為，因此 \"合規\" 更為恰當。此外，第一個翻譯 \"風險管理與合規性\" 虽然語法正確，但在專業語境中略顯不自然。\n因此，最佳翻譯為 \"風險管理與合規\"。\n\n近年來金融市場的高波動性凸顯了風險管理的重要性。為內部及外聘管理的投資組合已設立嚴格的控制措施及投資指引，並密切監察對指引及規則的遵守情況。風險控制工具已調配以評估在正常及不利市場情況下的市場風險。香港金融管理局亦進行詳細的績效歸因分析，以最優惠方式運用內部及外部管理者的投資技能。\n\n# 交易所基金表現\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# PERFORMANCE OF THE EXCHANGE FUND.\" The term \"Exchange Fund\" is critical here, and although the dictionary is empty, we can infer that \"Exchange Fund\" likely refers to a specific financial entity, such as a central bank's foreign exchange reserve fund or a regulated investment fund.\nAmong the junior translators' submissions, several variations exist:\n1. **\"交易所基金表現\"** – This is concise and uses the term \"交易所基金\" (exchange fund), which is a direct translation of \"Exchange Fund.\" However, it omits the word \"the\" and \"performance of,\" which may slightly affect clarity.\n2. **\"交易所基金的表現\"** – This version includes the possessive particle \"的,\" making it grammatically more complete in Traditional Chinese. It reads as \"the performance of the exchange fund,\" which is more natural and fluent.\n3. **\"基金表現\"** – This is overly brief and omits \"Exchange,\" which could lead to ambiguity, especially if the context is not clear.\n4. **\"兌換基金的表現\"** – This uses \"兌換基金\" (exchange fund), which is a slightly different term than \"交易所基金.\" While both are acceptable, \"交易所基金\" is more commonly used in financial contexts to refer to exchange-traded funds or similar instruments.\nGiven these observations, the most accurate and natural translation would be **\"交易所基金的表現\"**, as it includes the possessive particle for grammatical completeness and uses the more standard financial term \"交易所基金\" for \"Exchange Fund.\" This translation is both fluent and culturally appropriate for a financial document in Traditional Chinese.\n\n# 2015年的金融市場\n\n全球金融市場在2015年呈現極高波動。股權市場，特別是遭遇前所未見的動盪。主要股權市場在上半年創下新高。然而，市場情緒在第3季急轉直下，源於中國內地增長憂慮，導致主要股權市場失守自年初以來的收益，並錄得顯著的季度損失。全球股權市場隨着市場情緒改善稍為回升，但其後再度惡化，朝向年底。由於與中國內地經濟密切聯繫，香港股市在2015年遜於其他主要股市。\n\n在主權債券市場上，儘管預期美國利率正常化及美國利率上行週期的開始，2015年較長期美國國債收益率仍適度上升，因正數情緒受到對全球經濟增長的憂慮、持續的全球通縮壓力以及地緣政治緊張局勢升溫所遏抑。另一方面，短期歐洲政府債券收益率下跌，部分甚至跌至負面領域，這是歐洲央行大力實施貨幣寬鬆政策所導致的。\n\n在匯市方面，美元在2015年持續強化，美元指數飆升接近10%，下預期美國政策利率正常化啟動的背景下。歐元在首季顯著削弱，創下自1999年以來歐元面世以來最大的單季跌幅，因歐洲央行於1月宣布量化寬鬆措施。另一方面，日圓在2015年對美元大致平穩。\n\n2015年主要貨幣、債券及股票市場的表現載於表1。\n\n# 備付金管理\n\n# 交易所基金的表現\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is \"# The Exchange Fund’s performance.\" The dictionary specifies that the apostrophe (’), which appears in \"Fund’s,\" must be translated as \"的\" in Traditional Chinese. This is a critical point, as it affects the grammatical correctness of the translation.\nLooking at the junior translators' work:\n1. **Translation 1:** \"# 交易所基金的表現\" – This is correct. It uses \"的\" appropriately after \"基金\" (fund), and the term \"交易所基金\" (exchange fund) is accurate. The use of the hash symbol (#) is preserved, which is common in headings or titles.\n2. **Translation 2:** Same as Translation 1. Also correct.\n3. **Translation 3:** \"# 匯風基金的表現\" – This is incorrect. \"匯風基金\" is not a standard translation for \"The Exchange Fund.\" It appears to be a creative or mistranslation, possibly conflating \"Exchange\" with \"匯風\" (which might be a brand or unrelated term). This is not appropriate for a formal or official title.\n4. **Translation 4:** \"聯匯基金的表現\" – This is also incorrect. \"聯匯基金\" (Lianhui Fund) is not a recognized translation of \"The Exchange Fund.\" It may be a misinterpretation or a brand name, not a proper translation.\n5. **Translation 5:** Same as Translation 1. Correct.\n6. **Translation 6:** \"# The Exchange Fund 的 表現\" – This is incorrect because it retains the English phrase \"The Exchange Fund\" instead of translating it. The dictionary requires that the apostrophe be translated as \"的,\" but the rest of the term must also be translated. \"The Exchange Fund\" should be translated as \"交易所基金\" or another appropriate equivalent.\n**Improvement Reasoning:**\nThe best translation should:\n- Accurately translate \"The Exchange Fund\" as \"交易所基金\" (exchange fund), which is the standard term in financial contexts.\n- Use \"的\" to replace the apostrophe in \"Fund’s,\" resulting in \"交易所基金的表現.\"\n- Maintain the hash symbol (#) as it appears in the original, which is common in titles or headings.\n- Avoid using non-standard or creative translations that do not align with the dictionary or the intended meaning.\nBased on this reasoning, the best possible translation is:\n# 交易所基金的表現\n\n在極其波動的金融市場及艱鉅嚴苛的投資環境情況下，證券投資基金於2015年錄得投資虧損158億港元，包括海外股票收益71億港元、香港股票虧損50億港元、債券收益159億港元、非美元資產的負面貨幣轉作效果449億港元，以及基金投資控股子公司持有的其他投資收益111億港元。負面貨幣轉作效果無可避免，因去年美元急升，將證券投資基金的非美元投資轉作港元時產生。另一方面，策略性組合錄得估值收益22億港元。\n\n香港儲備基金的總資產在2015年底達到34,229億港元。2015年，香港儲備基金（不包括策略性組合）的投資回報為-0.6%。儘管如此，與表現較遜色的主要市場指數及一般投資基金社會相比，香港儲備基金的虧損可視為溫和。預見投資環境惡化，香港金融管理局在過去幾年已部署一系列防禦性措施，包括縮短債券組合的年期、增加現金持有量，以及顯著減少非美元資產。我們亦加快了投資多元化步伐，特別是透過長期增長計劃下的投資。這些措施增強了儲備基金的韌性，並有助減少潛在虧損。\n\n基金自1994年至2015年的年回報載於圖1。表2顯示2015年的投資回報，以及基金在不同年期的平均投資回報。過去三年的平均回報為1.2%，過去五年的平均回報為1.8%，過去十年的平均回報為3.3%，自1994年以來的平均回報為5.0%。表3顯示2015年12月31日基金資產的貨幣組合。\n\n圖1 交易所基金投資回報（1994 – 2015）  \n1 投資回報計算不包括策略性組合的持有量。  \n2 綜合消費者物價指數是基於2009\/2010年系列計算。\n"}
{"en":"# Corporate Functions\n\nThe HKMA maintains effective communications with the community and the market through the media, public education programmes, and various other channels to facilitate understanding of its policies and operations. In 2015, the HKMA improved corporate governance by supporting professional development of staff, instituting rigorous financial discipline, enhancing IT security, and realigning duties among senior management to help cope with challenges arising from the implementation of new programmes and systems and the increasing complexity of work.\n\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n\n# Media relations\n\nThe HKMA works closely with the media to improve transparency and promote public understanding of its policies and work. In 2015, 59 open media events were held, comprising 14 news conferences, 14 stand-up interviews and 31 other public functions. A further 43 media interviews were arranged, 325 bilingual press releases were issued and a substantial number of media enquiries were handled daily.\n\nIn addition, to enhance public understanding of the HKMA's key functions, two media tours were organised to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited and Hong Kong Interbank Clearing Limited (HKICL) respectively to showcase Hong Kong's world-class note printing technologies and financial infrastructure. Educational workshops were conducted on the Currency Board system, renminbi business and the Exchange Fund for a more in-depth briefing for the media on these important subjects.\n\nHKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan (centre), and Executive Director (Monetary Management), Mr Howard Lee (right), inspect security features on banknotes during a media visit to the Hong Kong Note Printing Limited.\n\nAn automated cheque sorting demonstration during a media tour to HKICL. In the middle of the photo (from left to right) are HKMA Chief Executive, Mr Norman Chan; Executive Director (Financial Infrastructure), Mr Esmond Lee; and HKICL Chief Executive Officer, Ms Haster Tang.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public enquiries\n\nThe Public Enquiry Service provides an effective means for people to obtain information from the HKMA, enabling them to get a greater understanding of the organisation's key functions. The Service handled 9,078 enquiries in 2015. About half of these related to banking policies and regulations, notes and coins, and consumer banking issues. Notable examples included prudential measures for property mortgage loans, banking products and services, prevention of money laundering and terrorist financing, and the coin collection programme.\n\nChart 1 shows the number of public enquiries received since 2012 and Chart 2 provides a breakdown by nature of the enquiries in 2015.\n\nChart 1 Total number of public enquiries\n\n# Publications\n\nApart from the HKMA Annual Report, the HKMA published two issues of the Half-Yearly Monetary and Financial Stability Report, 4 issues of the Quarterly Bulletin, and released regular updates of the Monthly Statistical Bulletin over the past year to provide up-to-date and thematic information and analyses on monetary, banking and economic issues in Hong Kong. In addition, senior management of the HKMA published 14 inSight articles covering various topical and timely policy issues.\n\nThe HKMA Annual Report 2014 received a Bronze award in the “non-profit Making and Charitable Organisations” category in the Hong Kong Management Association’s 2015 Best Annual Reports Awards.\n\n# The HKMA website\n\nThe HKMA corporate website (www.hkma.gov.hk), with over 50,000 pages in English and traditional and simplified Chinese, is the public access gateway to up-to-date information about the HKMA. It also contains the Register of Securities Staff of Authorized Institutions (AIs) and the Register of AIs and Local Representative Offices, both maintained under section 20 of the Banking Ordinance. With the implementation of the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, the website will also contain the register of stored value facility licensees under the Ordinance. Dedicated webpage and eye-catching short-cut links have been provided to draw the public's attention to important and timely information on issues such as reminders on the need to remain vigilant against bogus phone calls and the location of the coin carts in the coin collection programme.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Public education programme\n\nThe HKMA Information Centre on the 55th Floor of Two International Finance Centre is an important resource for introducing the work of the HKMA to the community and promoting public awareness of monetary and banking matters. The Centre consists of the Exhibition Area and the Library, and is open to the public six days a week. The Exhibition Area introduces the work of the HKMA and the development of money and banking in Hong Kong. It includes reading materials and exhibits for the study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs.\n\nGuided tours of the Information Centre are organised for visitors. During the year, the Centre received more than 48,300 visitors and hosted over 630 quided tours for schools and other groups (Chart 3). Over 530,400 people have visited the Information Centre since it opened in December 2003.\n\nThe Library, situated next to the Exhibition Area, houses more than 23,000 books, journals and other publications for the detailed study of Hong Kong's monetary, banking and financial affairs and central banking topics. It also maintains an electronic register of AIs in Hong Kong as required by section 20 of the Banking Ordinance.\n\nIn its ongoing programme to reach out to the community, the HKMA continued to organise public education seminars. In 2015, three seminars were held for some 2,300 secondary school students and teachers. Topics included the Linked Exchange Rate System, banknotes in Hong Kong, the smart use of credit cards and the Deposit Protection Scheme. More than 54,700 people have participated in the programme since its launch in 1998.\n\nChart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre\n\nYoung visitors learn about the development of money and banking in Hong Kong during a guided tour of the Information Centre.\n\nSecondary school students and teachers participate in a public education seminar.\n\n# HUMAN RESOURCES\n\nThe HKMA recruits, develops and maintains a highly professional workforce to support its policy objectives and respond flexibly to changing work priorities. While the HKMA is an integral part of the Government, it is able to employ staff on terms different from those of the civil service to attract personnel with the right experience and expertise. As a public organisation, the HKMA aims to maintain a lean and flexible structure and to redeploy staff resources to undertake new initiatives and meet increased workload.\n\n# Organisational changes\n\nFollowing the enactment of the payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance, a new Retail Payment Oversight Division was formed under the Monetary Management Department (MMD) in December 2015 to carry out the HKMA’s new statutory duties in the licensing and day-to-day supervision of stored value facilities and other retail payment systems. To enhance synergy amongst departments and reprioritise staff resources in coping with the challenges arising from the implementation of new initiatives as well as increasing workload and complexity of work, reshuffling of duties among a number of departments was planned in 2015 for implementation in early 2016. Details are as follows:\n\nThe Financial Infrastructure Department (FID) took over the administration of the Deposit Protection Scheme and the settlement function from the Enforcement Department (ENFD) and the Currency Division from MMD. It also took over from the Banking Departments certain banking-related work such as consumer education, directors’ development and enhanced competency framework for bank practitioners;\n\nThe External Department took over the market development function of MMD, while the latter will continue with its work relating to the Treasury Markets Association and financial benchmarks; and\n\nENFD took over the Anti-Money laundering (AML) and Financial Crime Risk Division from the Banking Supervision Department, and was retitled as Enforcement and AML Department.\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\n# Staffing\n\nThe establishment of the HKMA in 2015 was 841. This is increased by 34 to 875 in 2016 (an increase of 4%) to ensure that sufficient resources are provided to cope with (i) the implementation of new legislation and initiatives, (ii) continuation of pilot projects proven necessary on an on-going basis, and (ii) the increasing complexity and volume of existing work. The new posts are deployed to the following functions:\n\nEnhancing banking and financial stability, which includes:\n\nstrengthening banking supervision work including on-site examination of banks' stress testing process, implementation of international banking standards and peer review exercises;\n\nstrengthening the supervision of banks' liquidity risk and cyber security risk management;\n\nimplementing the supervisory framework regarding over-the-counter (OTC) derivatives conducted through banks and approved money brokers under the newly effective OTC derivatives reporting and record-keeping rules;\n\nstrengthening supervisory and enforcement efforts in anti-money laundering and counter-terrorist financing;\n\ngearing up the planning and preparatory work for the implementation of the Financial Institutions (Resolution) Bill, which applies international standards to address the \"too big to fail\" problem of the financial industry;\n\npromoting capacity building in the banking sector through the development of a director empowerment programme for independent non-executive directors of banks to further improve the governance of banks and collaboration with the industry to promote enhanced competency frameworks for banking practitioners engaged in core areas of banking operations;\n\nstepping up the banking conduct policy and research capability in new banking, securities and insurance products;\n\nenhancing consumer protection and consumer education efforts; and\n\nstepping up the monitoring and analysis of developments in the onshore renminbi market and in the CNH market with a view to supporting the orderly operation of Hong Kong’s offshore renminbi market.\n\nStrengthening investment, risk management and legal support to the expanding investment activities associated with the establishment of the Future Fund and further diversification of the Exchange Fund’s investment products, and enhancing strategic asset allocation and investment processes in the light of an increasingly challenging investment environment.\n\nImplementing the new statutory regime which empowers the HKMA to regulate stored value facilities and retail payment systems under the Payment Systems and Stored Value Facilities Ordinance.\n\n\n# Corporate Functions\n\nTemporary resources are deployed to meet other work demands. The HKMA transfers staff on secondment to other international or local organisations such as the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and the Financial Services Development Council to assist in activities or policy initiatives in which Hong Kong or the HKMA has an interest. Some staff members are deployed on a full-time or part-time basis to provide operational support to the Hong Kong Deposit Protection Board and the Treasury Markets Association.\n\n# Remuneration policies and pay review mechanism\n\nThe Financial Secretary (FS) determines the pay and conditions of service for HKMA staff on the advice of the Governance Sub-Committee (GSC) through the Exchange Fund Advisory Committee (EFAC), taking into account the prevailing market rates and practices. Remuneration comprises a total cash package and a provident fund scheme, with minimal benefits in kind. The cash package consists of monthly fixed pay (or basic pay) and variable pay, which may be awarded to individual staff members as a lump sum once a year depending on performance.\n\nPay for HKMA staff is reviewed annually by the FS in the light of recommendations made to him by the GSC through EFAC, taking into account the GSC's assessment of the performance of the HKMA in the preceding year, the pay-survey findings of the financial sector conducted by independent human resources consultants and any other relevant factors. Special pay adjustments may be made from time to time for individual meritorious staff to maintain their pay competitiveness.\n\nAny approved annual adjustments to the fixed pay or any variable pay awards for the HKMA are distributed to individual staff based on their performance. Investment professionals in the HKMA are subject to a variable pay system that seeks to strengthen the linkage between their investment performance and remuneration award. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Executive Director or above are approved by the FS on the advice of the GSC. The staff members concerned are not present at the meetings when their pay is discussed. The pay adjustments or awards for individual staff members at the ranks of Division Head and below are determined by the Chief Executive of the HKMA under delegated authority from the FS and within the approved overall pay awards.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

企業職能\n\n香港金融管理局透過媒體、公眾教育計劃及各種其他渠道，與社會及市場保持有效溝通，以增進對其政策及運作的了解。2015年，香港金融管理局優化企業管治，透過推動員工專業發展、嚴格控制財務紀律、加強資訊科技保安，以及重整高層管理職責，以應付因推行新計劃及系統以及工作日益繁重所帶來的挑戰。\n\n# 參與社會 企業發展\n# ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\n## Review of Translations\nThe original English text is a title: **\"ENGAGING THE COMMUNITY CORPORATE DEVELOPMENT\"**. The dictionary specifies that the term **\"community\"** must be translated as **\"社會\"**. The other terms, such as **\"engaging\"**, **\"corporate\"**, and **\"development\"**, are not in the dictionary and should be translated freely.\n### Evaluation of Junior Translations:\n1. **Translation 1: # 參與社會 企業發展**  \n   - **Strengths**: Correctly uses \"社會\" for \"community\" and translates the rest naturally. The use of \"參與\" for \"engaging\" is appropriate.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: The title is split into two parts with a space, which may not be ideal for a title format.  \n   - **Score**: Good.\n2. **Translation 2: # 參與社會 企業發展**  \n   - **Strengths**: Identical to Translation 1.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Same as above.  \n   - **Score**: Good.\n3. **Translation 3: # 傳動社會 企業發展**  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"社會\" correctly.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"傳動\" is not a standard translation for \"engaging\" and may be confusing.  \n   - **Score**: Poor.\n4. **Translation 4: 參與社會 企業發展**  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of \"社會\" and natural translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: Lacks the **#** symbol, which may be important for formatting.  \n   - **Score**: Good.\n5. **Translation 5: # 參與社會企業發展**  \n   - **Strengths**: Correct use of \"社會\" and natural translation.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: No space between \"社會\" and \"企業發展\", which may affect readability.  \n   - **Score**: Good.\n6. **Translation 6: # 參與社區企業發展**  \n   - **Strengths**: Uses \"社區\" for \"community\", which is also acceptable.  \n   - **Weaknesses**: \"社區\" is more specific than \"社會\", which may not align with the intended meaning of \"community\" in this context.  \n   - **Score**: Fair.\n### Reasoning for Best Translation:\nThe best translation should:\n- Use **\"社會\"** for **\"community\"** as per the dictionary.\n- Use **\"參與\"** for **\"engaging\"**, which is natural and commonly used in this context.\n- Use **\"企業發展\"** for **\"corporate development\"**, which is standard in business contexts.\n- Maintain the **#** symbol for proper formatting.\n- Ensure proper spacing and readability.\n### Final Translation:\n# 參與社會 企業發展\n\n# 媒體關係\n# 媒體關係\n媒體關係\n媒體關係\n# 傳媒關係\n媒體關係\n媒體關係\n經過審視，所有翻譯都正確地將「Media relations」翻譯為「媒體關係」或「傳媒關係」。其中，「媒體關係」是較常見的翻譯，而「傳媒關係」則較少見，但語意相近。所有翻譯在語法、用詞和文化適應性方面均無明顯問題。然而，第五位翻譯者在「媒體關係」前加上了「#」符號，與原文格式不一致，因此不建議採用。綜合考量，「媒體關係」是最自然、最符合常規用法的翻譯。因此，最佳翻譯為「媒體關係」。\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）與媒體密切合作，以改善透明度並促進公眾對其政策和工作的理解。2015年，共舉辦了59場公開媒體活動，包括14場新聞發佈會、14場站立採訪及31場其他公開活動。另外還安排了43場媒體採訪，發行了325份雙語新聞稿，並每日處理大量媒體查詢。\n\n此外，為優化公眾對香港金融管理局主要職能的理解，分別舉辦兩場媒體參觀活動，前往香港印鈔有限公司及香港銀行同業結算有限公司（HKICL），以展示香港世界級的鈔票印刷技術及金融基礎設施。同時進行有關貨幣發行局制度、人民幣業務及外匯基金的教育研討會，以向媒體提供這些重要主題的更深入簡報。\n\n香港金融管理局首席執行官陳德霖先生（中間）及執行董事（貨幣管理）李浩華先生（右）在媒體到訪香港印鈔有限公司期間檢查紙幣的保安特徵。\n\n在香港生產力中心（HKICL）進行的媒體參觀活動中，進行了自動化支票分類示範。在圖的中間（從左至右）為香港金融管理局（HKMA）總裁陳德霖先生；執行董事（財務基礎設施）李志明先生；以及香港生產力中心（HKICL）首席執行官唐哈斯特女士。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 公眾查詢\n\n公眾查詢服務為市民提供了一個有效的途徑，以從香港金融管理局（HKMA）獲取資訊，使他們能更深入了解該機構的主要職能。該服務在2015年處理了9,078宗查詢。其中約一半的查詢涉及銀行政策與法規、紙幣與硬幣，以及消費者銀行業務問題。值得注意的例子包括物業按揭貸款的審慎措施、銀行產品與服務、防止洗錢及恐怖主義融資，以及硬幣收集計劃。\n\n圖1顯示自2012年以來接獲的公眾查詢數目，而圖2則顯示2015年按查詢性質分類的資料。\n\n圖1 公眾查詢總數目\n圖1 總數目公共查詢\n圖1 總數目公眾查詢\n圖1 總數目之公眾查詢\n圖1 總數目公眾查詢\n圖1 總數目 公眾查詢\n各譯文均正確使用了詞彙表中「圖」、「總」、「數目」的對應譯法，但語序與語感略有差異。第一譯文語序自然，符合中文表達習慣；第二譯文語序顛倒，語感不順；第三、五譯文語序正確，但「總數目」與「公眾查詢」之間缺乏連接詞，略顯生硬；第四譯文使用「之」字，雖文雅但略顯繁複；第六譯文使用空格分隔，不符合中文排版習慣。\n最佳譯文應當語序自然、語感流暢，符合中文表達習慣，且不使用不必要的連接詞或標點。因此，第一譯文「圖1 公眾查詢總數目」最為優秀，語序自然，語感流暢，符合中文表達習慣。\n圖1 公眾查詢總數目\n\n# 刊物\n\n除香港金融管理局年度報告外，香港金融管理局在過去一年內亦發表了兩份上半年貨幣及金融穩定報告、四份季度通訊，並定期更新《月度統計通訊》的最新資料，以提供有關香港貨幣、銀行及經濟事宜的最新及主題性資訊和分析。此外，香港金融管理局高層管理人員亦發表了14篇涵蓋各種熱門及適時政策議題的深入了解文章。\n\n香港金融管理局2014年度報告在2015年香港管理協會「最佳年度報告獎項」的「非營利機構及慈善組織」類別中獲得了銅獎。\n\n# 香港金融管理局網站\n\n香港金融管理局機構網站（www.hkma.gov.hk）提供逾五萬頁的英文、傳統中文及簡體中文資料，是公眾獲取有關香港金融管理局最新資訊的入口。網站亦載有《銀行條例》第20條所維持的「認可機構（AIs）證券從業員登記冊」及「認可機構及本地代表辦事處登記冊」。隨著《支付系統及儲值憑證設施條例》的推行，網站將會載有根據該條例的儲值憑證設施牌照持有人登記冊。為引起公眾對重要及適時資訊的關注，網站已設有專門網頁及醒目快捷連結，例如提醒公眾需保持警覺以應對詐騙來電，以及硬幣收集計劃中硬幣收集車的分布位置等資訊。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 公共教育計畫\n# 公共教育計劃\n公眾教育計畫\n#公共教育計畫\n# 公眾教育計劃\n公共教育項目\n所有翻譯都大致正確，但各有細節差異。主要差異在於「public education」的翻譯，有使用「公共教育」也有使用「公眾教育」，而「programme」則有「計畫」、「計劃」、「項目」等不同翻譯。根據語境和常用語法，「計畫」較為常用且符合傳統中文語法。\n最佳翻譯為「公共教育計畫」，因為「計畫」在傳統中文中較常用於正式文件和計畫名稱，且語法正確。其他翻譯雖正確，但「計畫」比「計劃」或「項目」更符合此語境。此外，標點符號的使用也需統一，避免使用不必要的井號「#」。\n公共教育計畫\n\n香港金融管理局資訊中心位於國際金融中心二期55樓，是向社會介紹香港金融管理局工作及推廣公眾對貨幣及銀行事務意識的重要資源。中心設有展覽區及圖書館，並於週一至週六開放公眾使用。展覽區介紹香港金融管理局的工作及香港貨幣與銀行業的發展，並包括有關香港貨幣、銀行及金融事務的閱讀資料及展品。\n\n資訊中心為訪客舉辦導賞參觀活動。在這一年中，中心接獲超過48,300名訪客，並為學校及其他團體舉辦了超過630場導賞參觀（圖3）。自2003年12月開放以來，已有超過530,400人參觀資訊中心。\n\n圖書館位於展覽區毗鄰，收藏超過23,000本書籍、期刊及其他刊物，供詳細研究香港的貨幣、銀行及金融事務和中央銀行主題。它亦根據《銀行條例》第20條的規定，保持香港認可機構的電子登記冊。\n\n為持續推廣金融知識，香港金融管理局繼續舉辦公眾教育研討會。2015年，為約2,300名中學生及教師舉辦了3場研討會。主題包括聯繫匯率制度、香港紙幣、信用卡的智醒使用及存款保障計劃。自1998年推出以來，已有超過54,700人參與該計劃。\n\n圖3 資訊中心團體參觀的種類\n審視各譯文後，發現第六位翻譯者所譯「圖3 資訊中心團體參觀的種類」最為準確。此譯文正確使用了「圖」、「種類」與「參觀」三個關鍵詞，語序自然，符合中文表達習慣，且準確傳達了「Chart 3 Types of group visits to the Information Centre」的原意。其他譯文或語序不當，或用詞不精準，如「團體種類」、「參觀種類」等語序與語意皆有偏差，未能準確反映原文結構與語意。因此，選擇第六位翻譯者的版本作為最終譯文。\n\n學童訪客在資訊中心的導覽參觀中，了解香港貨幣與銀行業的發展歷程。\n\n二手學校學生及教師參與公開教育研討會。\n\n# 人力資源\n\n香港金融管理局招聘、培訓及維持一支具備極高專業水平的工作隊伍，以支持其政策目標，並靈活應對工作重點的變化。雖然香港金融管理局是政府的一部分，但它能夠以與公務員不同的條件僱用員工，以吸引具備適當經驗及專業投資技術的人員。作為一個公共機構，香港金融管理局致力保持精簡靈活的架構，並調配員工資源，推行新措施，以應對增加的工作量。\n\n# 組織變動\n\n繼《支付系統及儲值設施條例》頒佈後，香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2015年12月在貨幣管理部（MMD）下設立零售支付監察部，以履行HKMA在儲值設施及其他零售支付系統的發牌及日常監管方面的法定職責。為優化部門間的協同效應，並重新調配員工資源以應對推行新措施所帶來的挑戰，以及日益增加的工作量和工作的複雜性，於2015年擬定在多個部門之間進行職務重組，並於2016年初推行。詳情如下：\n\n金融基建部（FiD）從法規部（ENFD）及MMD的貨幣科接管了存款保障計劃的行政工作及結算功能。它亦從銀行部門接管若干銀行業相關工作，例如消費者教育、董事發展及加強銀行從業員的能力建構框架；\n\n外部部門接替了MMD的市場發展職能，而後者將繼續從事與財政市場協會及財務指標有關的工作；且\n\n法規部從銀行監督部門接管了反洗錢（AML）及金融犯罪風險部門，並更名為執法與反洗錢部門。\n\n# 企業職能\n\n# 人手編制\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）於2015年成立時，職位數為841個。此數字於2016年增加34個，增至875個（增加4%），以確保提供充足資源，應付（i）新法例及措施的推行，（ii）持續進行已證明為必要之試點項目，以及（iii）現行工作日益繁重及工作量增加。新設職位將調配至以下職能：\n\n加強銀行及金融穩定性，包括：\n\n加強銀行監管工作，包括對銀行壓力測試過程的現場檢查、推行國際銀行標準以及同儕審查活動；\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Correct use of dictionary terms (\"加強\", \"包括\", \"推行\").  \n   - Weaknesses: \"審查實務\" is awkward and not idiomatic in this context. \"exercises\" should be translated as \"活動\" or \"實務\" is not appropriate here.  \n2. **Translation by the second junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Accurate use of dictionary terms, natural phrasing.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"同業評審活動\" is slightly less precise than \"同儕審查活動\" in the context of international banking standards.  \n3. **Translation by the third junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Correct use of dictionary terms.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"exercises\" is left in English, which is a clear error.  \n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Natural and fluent, with appropriate use of dictionary terms.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"同儕審查活動\" is slightly more natural than \"同業評審活動\" in this context.  \n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Natural phrasing.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"現場審查\" is less precise than \"現場檢查\" for \"on-site examination.\" \"同行評審\" is acceptable but slightly less formal than \"同儕審查.\"  \n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator:**  \n   - Strengths: Natural and fluent, with appropriate use of dictionary terms.  \n   - Weaknesses: \"實地檢查\" is slightly less common than \"現場檢查\" in this context.  \n**Reasoning for Best Translation:**  \nThe best translation should use the most natural and idiomatic expressions while adhering strictly to the dictionary terms. \"現場檢查\" is more commonly used than \"實地檢查\" or \"現場審查\" in the context of banking supervision. \"同儕審查活動\" is more precise and formal than \"同業評審活動\" or \"同行評審.\" \"推行國際銀行標準\" is accurate and idiomatic. Therefore, the best translation combines these elements into a fluent and natural sentence.\n\n加強對銀行流動性風險及網絡安全風險管理的監管；\n所有翻譯均正確使用了「加強」一詞，符合詞典要求。各版本在語法和用詞上均無明顯錯誤，但細節上略有差異。第一、二、六版使用「網絡」，第三、四、五版使用「網路」，兩者在語義上均可接受，但「網絡」更常見於金融風險管理語境中。此外，「監管」與「監督」在語義上略有差異，「監管」更強調制度性管理，而「監督」則偏重於檢查與督促，根據原文語境，「監管」更為恰當。因此，最佳翻譯應為：加強對銀行流動性風險及網絡安全風險管理的監管；\n\n推行有關透過銀行及經批准的貨幣經紀人進行場外（OTC）衍生工具交易的監督框架，根據新生效的場外衍生工具報告及記錄保存規則；\n\n加強反洗錢及反恐融資的監督與執法工作；\n\n正在籌備推行《金融機構（解決）條例》的規劃及籌備工作，以國際標準解決金融業「太大而不能倒」的問題；\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator** is mostly accurate, but it repeats the word “籌備” twice, which is redundant. Also, “太大而不能倒” is a common and natural phrasing, but the original uses “too big to fail,” which is more commonly translated as “太大而不能倒” or “大而不倒.”\n2. **Translation by the second junior translator** uses “無法倒閉” instead of “倒閉,” which is not in the dictionary. The term “fail” is defined as “倒閉,” so “無法倒閉” is incorrect. Also, “太大而無法倒閉” is awkward and not idiomatic.\n3. **Translation by the third junior translator** uses “決策” instead of “解決” for the term in the bill’s title, which is incorrect. Also, “大到不能倒閉” is not idiomatic and misuses the term “倒閉.”\n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator** uses “解決” correctly and “大而不倒” is a natural and commonly used phrase. However, the structure is slightly awkward, and the phrase “應用國際標準” is less natural than “採用國際標準.”\n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator** is the most comprehensive and accurate. It uses “解決” correctly, “大到無法倒閉” is a natural variation, and it includes the term “法案” which is appropriate for a legislative bill. However, “應用國際標準” is slightly less natural than “採用國際標準.”\n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator** uses “紓困” instead of “解決” for the bill’s title, which is incorrect. “紓困” means “relief” or “bailout,” not “resolution.”\n**Improved Translation:**\n為推行《金融機構（解決）條例》的規劃及籌備工作，該條例採用國際標準以解決金融業「太大而不能倒」的問題；\n\n透過發展針對銀行獨立非執行董事的董事賦權計劃，以促進銀行業的能力建設，進一步改善銀行的治理，並與業界合作，促進銀行從業人員在銀行運作核心範疇的專業能力框架提升。\n\n加強在新型銀行、證券及保險產品中的銀行行為規範政策與研究能力；\n\n加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作；以及\n審視各譯文後，發現所有譯文均正確使用了「加強」來翻譯「enhancing」，符合詞典要求。在連接詞方面，「以及」與「並」皆可使用，但「以及」更符合書面語的語氣，與前文語境更為契合。在「及」與「和」的選擇上，「及」在正式文本中更常見，語氣更莊重，因此採用「加強消費者保護及消費者教育工作」為佳。最終譯文在語法、用詞與語氣上皆自然流暢，符合傳統中文的表達習慣。\n\n加強監測及分析在岸人民幣市場與CNH市場的發展，以推動香港離岸人民幣市場的有序運作。\n\n加強對與未來基金成立及交易所基金投資產品進一步多元化相關的擴展投資活動的投資、風險管理及法律支持，並在日益艱鉅嚴苛的投資環境下，加強策略性資產配置及投資流程。\n\n推行新的法定制度，賦權香港金融管理局根據《支付系統及儲值設施條例》監管儲值設施及零售支付系統。\n\n\n# 企業職能\n\n臨時資源被調配以滿足其他工作需求。香港金融管理局將員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，以協助進行香港或香港金融管理局有興趣的活動或政策措施。部分員工以全職或兼職形式被調配，以提供運作支援予香港存款保障局及財政市場協會。\n臨時資源被調配以滿足其他工作需求。香港金融管理局將員工借調至其他國際或本地機構，例如國際貨幣基金組織（IMF）及金融服務發展委員會，以協助進行香港或香港金融管理局有興趣的活動或政策措施。部分員工以全職或兼職形式被調配，以提供運作支援予香港存款保障局及財政市場協會。\n\n# 薪酬政策與薪酬審查機制\n\n財政司司長（FS）根據外匯基金諮詢委員會（EFAC）下轄的管治小組委員會（GSC）的建議，決定香港金融管理局（HKMA）員工的薪酬及服務條件，並考慮現行市場水平及慣例。薪酬包括總現金報酬包及供款基金計劃，實物福利為基本。現金報酬包由每月固定薪酬（或基本薪酬）及浮動薪酬組成，浮動薪酬可根據表現，每年以一次性總額頒發予個別員工。\n\n香港金管局員工的薪酬每年由財政司司長檢討，鑑於外匯基金諮詢委員會透過GSC向其提出的建議，並考慮GSC對HKMA上一年度表現的評估、由獨立人力資源顧問公司進行的金融界薪酬調查結果，以及任何其他有關因素。為維持薪酬競爭力，可不時為個別表現優異的員工作出特別薪酬調整。\n\n任何經批准的年度固定薪酬調整或香港金融管理局（HKMA）的浮動薪酬獎項，均會根據員工的表現分配給個別員工。HKMA的投資專業人員會面對一套浮動薪酬制度，旨在強化其投資表現與薪酬獎項之間的聯繫。對於職級為執行董事或以上個別員工的薪酬調整或獎項，須由財政司司長（FS）根據財務委員會（GSC）的建議批准。有關員工在討論其薪酬的會議上不會在場。至於職級為部門主管或以下的個別員工的薪酬調整或獎項，則由香港金融管理局總裁根據財政司司長授予的授權，在已批准的整體薪酬獎項範圍內制定。\n"}

大事紀要 2015\n\n# 2015年大事紀要（繼續）\n\n# 7 月 9 日\n\n由香港金管局、澳洲財政部及澳洲儲備銀行籌辦的第3季香港-澳洲人民幣貿易與投資對話，於澳洲悉尼舉行。\n\n香港金融管理局宣布在中央貨幣市場單位的基金訂單路由服務框架下推出新的跨境聯繫，以提供訂單路由及結算支援，協助內地與香港互認基金計劃。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估六位初級翻譯的譯文時，我們需從語法、流暢度、用詞準確性與文化適應性等多方面進行審視。首先，所有譯文都正確使用了詞典中指定的翻譯，如「announces」翻譯為「宣布」、「launch」為「推出」、「provide」為「提供」、「recognition」為「肯定」。然而，其中第五位翻譯將「recognition」誤譯為「肯定」，與「Mutual Recognition of Funds」的語境不符，應為「互認」，因此第五位譯文存在明顯錯誤。\n其次，從語法與流暢度來看，第一、第二、第六位譯文較為自然，語序符合中文習慣。第三位譯文使用了「中央結算系統」，與原文「Central Moneymarkets Unit」不一致，屬於誤譯。第四位譯文雖語法正確，但「联动计划」與「聯繫」語義不完全對應，略顯生硬。第五位譯文因「肯定」一詞使用錯誤，整體語義偏離原意。\n在用詞方面，「cross border linkage」譯為「跨境聯繫」或「跨境連結」皆可接受，但「聯繫」更符合正式語境。此外，「Fund Order Routing Service」應譯為「基金訂單路由服務」，而第三位譯文使用「基金轉駁服務」，與原意不符。\n綜合考量語法、語義與語境，最佳的翻譯應當在語法正確、語義準確、語序自然的前提下，忠實反映原文內容。因此，最終譯文採用第六位譯文的結構，並調整語序與用詞，使其更符合正式文件的語境與語法規範。\n\n# 7 月 10 日\n\n根據《證券及期貨（修訂）條例》2014年附屬法例，為落實新場外衍生工具監管制度下的強制報告及相關記錄保存義務，現已開始實施。\n\n# 7 月 17 日\n\n《2015年稅務（修訂）（第2號）條例》已刊憲，將離岸基金的利潤稅免稅擴展至私人股權基金。\n\n# 7月8日\n\n第五隻與通貨膨脹掛鉤的零售債券，或稱iBond，是根據政府債券計劃發行的。\n第五期與通脹掛鈎的零售債券，或稱「iBond」，乃根據政府債券計劃發行。\n第五期與物價指數掛鉤零售債券，或稱iBond，是根據政府債券計劃發行的。\n第五個與通貨膨脹掛鉤的零售債券，或iBond，根據政府債券計劃發行。\n第五與物價掛鉤零售債券，或稱iBond，是根據國債計劃發行的。\n第五期通脹掛鈎零售債券，或稱iBond，是根據政府債券計劃發行。\n評審與分析：\n1. 第一位翻譯者使用了「第五隻」，但「fifth」在這裡是序數詞，應翻譯為「第五」，而非「隻」，「隻」通常用於動物或物品，不適合用於債券。此外，「根據政府債券計劃發行」語法正確，但可更自然地表達為「根據政府債券計劃發行」。\n2. 第二位翻譯者使用了「第五期」，語法正確，但「期」在這裡可能不恰當，「fifth」更適合翻譯為「第五」。此外，「乃根據」語氣較為文言，與現代語境不完全契合。\n3. 第三位翻譯者使用了「第五期」與「物價指數」，其中「物價指數」雖然正確，但「fifth」應為「第五」，而非「第五期」。此外，「零售債券」前缺少「的」，語法上略顯不完整。\n4. 第四位翻譯者使用了「第五個」，語法正確，但「個」在這裡不恰當，「fifth」應為「第五」。此外，「或iBond」缺少「稱」字，語法上略顯不完整。\n5. 第五位翻譯者使用了「第五與物價掛鉤」，語法上不完整，缺少「的」字，且「國債計劃」與原文「Government Bond Programme」不完全一致，應為「政府債券計劃」。\n6. 第六位翻譯者使用了「第五期通脹掛鈎」，語法正確，但「期」不恰當，「fifth」應為「第五」。此外，「通脹掛鈎」語法正確，但可更自然地表達為「與通脹掛鉤」。\n總結：所有翻譯都正確使用了「發行」與「第五」，但語法與用詞上仍有改進空間。最佳翻譯應使用「第五」而非「第五期」或「第五個」，並確保語法正確、語氣自然。\n最佳翻譯：\n第五隻與通貨膨脹掛鉤的零售債券，或稱iBond，是根據政府債券計劃發行的。\n\n# 8月31日\n\n香港金融管理局（HKMA）與香港銀行公會（HKAB）及其成員銀行一同宣布，將共同努力提高公眾對來電騙案的意識，並協助進一步保護銀行客戶的權益。\n\n# 2015年大事紀要（繼續）\n\n# 9月30日\n\n香港金融管理局與證券及期貨事務監理機制聯合推出諮詢，就新場外衍生工具監管制度下引入首輪強制清算及第二階段強制報告進行諮詢。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation by the first junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Correctly uses the dictionary terms and maintains a formal tone.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses “外匯衍生工具” instead of “場外衍生工具,” which is a misinterpretation of “over-the-counter derivatives.” Also, the phrase “進行諮詢” is redundant and awkward.  \n2. **Translation by the second junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct dictionary terms and structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Leaves “mandatory clearing” and “mandatory reporting” in English, which violates the requirement to use the provided translations. Also, “首輪 mandatory clearing” is inconsistent in language.  \n3. **Translation by the third junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct dictionary terms and maintains clarity.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** The phrase “以引入...” is slightly awkward and less formal than the original.  \n4. **Translation by the fourth junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct dictionary terms and provides a natural flow.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses “申報” instead of “報告,” which is not the best match for “reporting.” Also, “此舉在新的場外衍生工具監管框架下進行” is a bit wordy and less direct.  \n5. **Translation by the fifth junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct dictionary terms and structure.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses “強制披露” instead of “強制報告,” which is not an exact match. Also, “第二強制披露階段” is awkwardly phrased.  \n6. **Translation by the sixth junior translator**  \n   - **Strengths:** Uses the correct dictionary terms and includes the acronyms (HKMA and SFC) as in the original.  \n   - **Weaknesses:** Uses “衍生品” instead of “衍生工具,” which is slightly less formal and precise.  \n**Improved Translation Reasoning:**  \nThe best translation should use the correct dictionary terms, maintain a formal and natural tone, and accurately reflect the original meaning. It should avoid redundancy, awkward phrasing, and incorrect terminology. Based on the above analysis, the improved translation should use “場外衍生工具” for “over-the-counter derivatives,” “首輪” for “first phase,” “第二階段” for “second phase,” and “強制清算” and “強制報告” for the respective terms. The structure should be concise and professional, as seen in the first and sixth translations, but with improved clarity and consistency.\n\n# 9 月 10 日\n\n針對香港金融機構設立有效解決機制的兩輪公眾諮詢回應已載於。\n\n# 10 月 15 日至 16 日\n\n香港金融管理局協辦在北京舉行的高水平研討會，對象為香港銀行的獨立非執行董事。"}
{"en":"# The Exchange Fund\n\nReport of the Director of Audit \nExchange Fund Financial Statements\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit\n\n# Audit Commission \n# The Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\n\n# Independent Audit Report\n\n# To the Financial Secretary\n\nI certify that I have audited the financial statements of the Exchange Fund and its subsidiaries (\"the Group\") set out on pages 134 to 222, which comprise the balance sheets of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and their income and expenditure accounts, statements of comprehensive income, statements of changes in equity and statements of cash flows for the year then ended, and a summary of significant accounting policies and other explanatory information.\n\n# Monetary Authority’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\n\nThe Monetary Authority is responsible for the preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Cap. 66) and Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, and for such internal control as the Monetary Authority determines is necessary to enable the preparation of financial statements that are free from material misstatement, whether due to fraud or error.\n\n# Auditor’s Responsibility\n\nMy responsibility is to express an opinion on these financial statements based on my audit. I conducted my audit in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance and the Audit Commission auditing standards. Those standards require that I comply with ethical requirements and plan and perform the audit to obtain reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free from material misstatement.\n\nAn audit involves performing procedures to obtain audit evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. The procedures selected depend on the auditor’s judgment, including the assessment of the risks of material misstatement of the financial statements, whether due to fraud or error. In making those risk assessments, the auditor considers internal control relevant to the entity’s preparation of financial statements that give a true and fair view in order to design audit procedures that are appropriate in the circumstances, but not for the purpose of expressing an opinion on the effectiveness of the entity’s internal control. An audit also includes evaluating the appropriateness of accounting policies used and the reasonableness of accounting estimates made by the Monetary Authority, as well as evaluating the overall presentation of the financial statements.\n\nI believe that the audit evidence I have obtained is sufficient and appropriate to provide a basis for my audit opinion.\n\n# Report of the Director of Audit (continued)\n\n# Opinion\n\nIn my opinion, the financial statements give a true and fair view of the financial position of the Exchange Fund and of the Group as at 31 December 2015, and of their financial performance and cash flows for the year then ended in accordance with Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards and have been properly prepared in accordance with the directive of the Chief Executive made under section 7 of the Exchange Fund Ordinance.\n\nDavid Sun \nDirector of Audit\n\n7 April 2016\n\nAudit Commission \n26th Floor \nImmigration Tower \n7 Gloucester Road \nWanchai, Hong Kong\n\n# Contents\n\nINCOME AND EXPENDITURE ACCOUNT\nSTATEMENT OF COMPREHENSIVE INCOME\nBALANCE SHEET\nATEMENT OF CHANGES IN EQUITY\nATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS\nNOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS:\n\n1.

The principal activities of the Fund are safeguarding the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong and maintaining the stability and integrity of Hong Kong's monetary and financial systems.\n\nThe assets of the Fund are managed as four portfolios: the Backing Portfolio, the Investment Portfolio, the Long-Term Growth Portfolio and the Strategic Portolio. The assets of the Backing Portolio fully match the Monetary Base, under Hong Kong's Currency Board system. The Investment Portfolio is invested primarily in the bond and equity markets of the member countries of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development. The Long-Term Growth Portfolio holds private equity and real estate investments. The Strategic Portfolio holds shares in Hong Kong Exchanges and Clearing Limited acquired by the Government of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region (HKSAR) for the account of the Fund for strategic purposes. Operating segment information is set out in note 31.\n\n# 2 SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES\n\n# 2.1 Statement of compliance\n\nThese financial statements have been prepared in accordance with all applicable Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards (HKFRSs), which is a collective term that includes all applicable individual Hong Kong Financial Reporting Standards, Hong Kong Accounting Standards (HKASs) and Interpretations issued by the Hong Kong Institute of Certified Public Accountants (HKICPA), and accounting principles generally accepted in Hong Kong. A summary of the significant accounting policies adopted by the Fund and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) is set out below.\n\nThe HKICPA has issued certain new and revised HKFRSs that are first effective or available for early adoption for the current accounting period. Note 3 provides information on the changes, if any, in accounting policies resulting from initial adoption of these developments to the extent that they are relevant to the Group for the current and prior accounting periods reflected in these financial statements.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\n# 2.2 Basis of preparation of the financial statements\n\nThe Group financial statements include the financial statements of the Group as well as the Group's interests in associates and joint ventures. The principal activities of the principal subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures are shown in notes 16 and 17.\n\nThe measurement basis used in the preparation of the financial statements is historical cost except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their fair values as explained in the accounting policies set out below:\n\ntrading financial instruments (note 2.6.2.1);\nfinancial assets and financial liabilities designated at fair value (note 2.6.2.2); available-for-sale securities (note 2.6.2.5);\ngold (note 2.11); and\ninvestment properties (note 2.12).\n\nThe preparation of financial statements in conformity with HKFRSs requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenditure. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis for making judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.\n\nThe estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.\n\nNote 18 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of investment properties. Note 37 contains information about the assumptions relating to fair value estimation of financial instruments. There are no critical accounting judgements involved in the application of the Group's accounting policies except for the valuation of certain financial instruments as set out in note 2.5.\n\n# 2.3 Subsidiaries and non-controlling interests\n\nA subsidiary is an entity controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. When assessing whether the Group has power, only substantive rights (held by the Group and other parties) are considered.\n\n# Exchange Fund – Notes to the Financial Statements (continued)\n\n(Amounts expressed in millions of Hong Kong dollars, unless otherwise stated.)\n\nAn investment in a subsidiary is consolidated into the Group financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.\n\nIntra-group balances, transactions and cash flows and any unrealised profits and losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in full in preparing the Group financial statements.\n\nNon-controlling interests represent the equity in a subsidiary not attributable directly or indirectly to the Fund, and in respect of which the Group has not agreed any additional terms with the holders of those interests which would result in the Group as a whole having a contractual obligation in respect of those interests that meets the definition of a financial liability. Non-controlling interests are presented in the Group balance sheet within equity, separately from equity attributable to the owner of the Fund. Non-controlling interests in the results of the Group are presented on the face of the Group income and expenditure account and the Group statement of comprehensive income as an allocation of the surplus or deficit and total comprehensive income or loss for the year between non-controlling interests and the owner of the Fund.\n\nIn the balance sheet of the Fund, its investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less impairment losses, if any (note 2.14).\n\n# 2.4 Associates and joint ventures\n\nAn associate is an entity in which the Group has significant influence, but not control or joint control, over its management, through its power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions.\n","terms":{"reach":["達"],"promoting":["以助發展"],"introduced":["提交"],"work":["工作"],"weaker":["轉弱"],"stays":["處於"],"HK":["本港"],"’":["的"],"capitalised":["資本充裕"],"swings":["大幅上落"],"enhance":["優化"],"raise":["上調"],"142.1":["1,421"],"supporting":["推動"],"instituting":["嚴格控制"],"stepped":["加強"],"improved":["優化"],"various":["各種"],"announcement":["公布"],"realigning":["重整"],"amounting":["為"],"3,422.9":["34,229"],"october":["10

外匯基金\n\n審計署署長報告  \n外匯基金財務報表\n審計署署長報告是對「report」一詞的正確翻譯，符合字典中「report」對應的「報告」一詞。而「Exchange Fund」在各譯文中出現了多種翻譯，如「匯生基金」、「交換基金」、「儲備基金」、「外匯基金」等。其中，「外匯基金」是最為準確且符合常見官方用語的翻譯，用於指代國家或地區的外匯儲備基金，語意明確且符合語境。因此，選擇「外匯基金財務報表」作為「Exchange Fund Financial Statements」的翻譯，既符合字典中「report」的對應翻譯，也確保了專業性和語境的準確性。\n\n# 審計主任的報告\n\n# 審計署  \n# 香港特別行政區政府\n\n# 獨立審計報告\n\n# 致財政司司長\n\n本人證明已審計外匯基金及其附屬機構（「該集團」）載於第134至222頁之財務報表，該財務報表包括外匯基金及該集團截至2015年12月31日之資產負債表，以及該會計年度之收入支出帳目、綜合損益表、權益變動表及現金流量表，以及重要會計政策概要及其他解釋性資料。\n\n# 貨幣當局對財務報表的責任\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English title is **\"Monetary Authority’s Responsibility for the Financial Statements\"**, and the dictionary specifies that the term **\"authority\"** must be translated as **\"權限\"**. However, in this context, \"authority\" refers to an **institution or body** with the power to regulate monetary policy, not merely \"authority\" as in \"power\" or \"permission.\" Therefore, the most appropriate translation for **\"Monetary Authority\"** should be **\"貨幣當局\"**, which is a standard term used in financial and regulatory contexts in Traditional Chinese.\n**Analysis of the junior translations:**\n1. **Translation 1:** *# 財政部對財務報表的責任*  \n   - **Issue:** \"財政部\" translates to \"Ministry of Finance,\" which is not the same as \"Monetary Authority.\" This is a misinterpretation of the term.\n   - **Score:** Low\n2. **Translation 2:** *# 貨幣權限對財務報表的責任*  \n   - **Issue:** \"權限\" is used directly as per the dictionary, but it is not appropriate here. \"權限\" means \"authority\/power\" rather than an institution. This translation is grammatically incorrect and semantically unclear.\n   - **Score:** Low\n3. **Translation 3:** *貨幣當局對財務報表的責任*  \n   - **Strength:** Correctly uses **\"貨幣當局\"** for \"Monetary Authority\" and omits the dictionary term \"authority\" since it is not needed in this context.\n   - **Score:** High\n4. **Translation 4:** *# 金融**權限**機構對財務報表的責任*  \n   - **Issue:** Uses **\"權限\"** from the dictionary, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the correct and most natural translation is:\n**# 貨幣當局對財務報表的責任**\n\n貨幣管理局負責根據行政長官根據《外匯基金條例》（第66章）第7條所頒布的指示，以及香港財務報告準則，編製提供真實且公允觀點的財務報表，並制定貨幣管理局認為必要以確保財務報表免受因欺詐或錯誤所導致的重大誤導的內部控制。\n\n# 審計師的責任\n\n我的責任是根據我的審計，對這些財務報表發表意見。我進行審計是根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7條頒發的指示以及審計委員會的審計標準進行的。這些標準要求我遵守道德要求，並規劃和執行審計，以取得合理保證，確保財務報表沒有重大錯報。\n我的責任是根據我的審計，對這些財務報表發表意見。我進行審計是根據行政長官根據《庫務條例》第7條頒發的指示以及審計委員會的審計標準進行的。這些標準要求我遵守道德要求，並規劃和執行審計，以取得合理保證，確保財務報表沒有重大錯報。\n\n審計涉及執行程序以取得有關財務報表數額及披露的審計證據。所選程序取決於審計師的判斷，包括評估財務報表中重大錯報的風險，無論是因舞弊或錯誤所致。在進行這些風險評估時，審計師會考慮與實體編製能提供真實及公允觀點的財務報表相關的內部控制，以設計在特定情況下適當的審計程序，但並非用於對實體內部控制的成效發表意見。審計亦包括評估所使用的會計政策的適當性，以及貨幣當局所作出的會計估計的合理性，並評估財務報表整體的呈報方式。\n\n我相信我所取得的審計證據是充足且適當的，足以作為我審計意見的基礎。\n\n# 審計長報告（繼續）\n\n# 觀點\n\n依我之見，財務報表真實及公允地反映了截至2015年12月31日為止的交易所基金及其集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流量，並根據香港財務報告準則編製，且已妥為根據行政長官根據《交易所基金條例》第7條所發出的指示進行編製。\n依我之見，財務報表真實及公允地反映了截至2015年12月31日為止的交易所基金及其集團的財務狀況，以及該年度的財務表現及現金流量，並根據香港財務報告準則編製，且已妥為根據行政長官根據《交易所基金條例》第7條所發出的指示進行編製。\n\n孫大衛  \n審計總監\n\n2016年4月7日\n\n審計委員會  \n26樓  \n入境事務大樓  \n告士打道7號  \n灣仔，香港\n\n# 目錄\n\n收入支出表  \n綜合收益表  \n資產負債表  \n股東權益變動表  \n現金流量表  \n財務報表附註：\n\n1. 主要業務  \n2. 重要會計政策  \n3. 會計政策變更  \n4. 收入與支出  \n5. 所得稅  \n6. 金融資產及金融負債類別  \n7. 現金及隨時動用的現金  \n8. 存放於銀行及其他金融機構  \n9. 指定按公允價值計量的金融資產  \n10. 可供出售證券  \n11. 衍生金融工具  \n12. 持有至到期證券  \n13. 貸款組合  \n14. 金  \n15. 其他資產  \n16. 子公司權益  \n17. 關聯方及合營企業權益  \n18. 投資性不動產  \n19. 房產、廠房及設備  \n20. 負債證明書、政府發行的紙幣及硬幣流通金額  \n21. 銀行體系餘額  \n22. 銀行及其他金融機構存放  \n23. 財政儲備存放  \n24. 香港特別行政區政府基金及法定機構存放  \n25. 發行的交換基金票據及債券  \n26. 銀行貸款  \n27. 發行的其他債務證券  \n28. 其他負債  \n29. 股東權益  \n30. 現金流量表中現金及現金等價物分析  \n31. 經營分部資訊  \n32. 質押資產  \n33. 承諾事項  \n34. 或有負債  \n35. 重大關聯方交易  \n36. 金融風險管理  \n37. 金融工具的公允價值評估  \n38. 非調整性財務報表日後事項  \n39. 對截至 2015 年 12 月 31 日止年度尚未生效的修訂、新準則及解釋的可能影響  \n40. 財務報表的批准\n\n# 外匯基金 – 收入及支出帳戶\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n所有翻譯都正確地將「31」、「year」和「December」轉換為「31」、「年」和「12 月」，符合詞彙對應的要求。然而，從語法和語感的角度來看，翻譯的流暢度和自然度存在差異。\n第一個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日年度」語法上略顯不完整，缺少「止」字，使句子結構不完整。\n第二個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日止年度」語法正確，語感自然，符合中文財務報告中常見的表達方式。\n第三個翻譯「2015 年 12 月 31 日止年度」雖然語法正確，但語序與常見表達方式略有出入，略顯生硬。\n第四個翻譯與第二個相同，語法正確，語感自然。\n第五個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日」缺少「年度」一詞，導致語義不完整。\n第六個翻譯與第二個相同，語法正確，語感自然。\n綜合考量語法正確性、語感自然度以及財務報告中常見的表達方式，最佳翻譯應為「截至2015年12月31日止年度」。此翻譯語法正確，語感自然，符合中文財務報告中常見的表達方式，且完整傳達了原句的語義。\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 綜合收益表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n所有翻譯都正確地將「31」、「year」和「December」轉換為「31」、「年」和「12 月」，符合詞彙對應的要求。然而，從語法和語感的角度來看，翻譯的流暢度和自然度存在差異。\n第一個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日年度」語法上略顯不完整，缺少「止」字，使句子結構不完整。\n第二個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日止年度」語法正確，語感自然，符合中文財務報告中常見的表達方式。\n第三個翻譯「2015 年 12 月 31 日止年度」雖然語法正確，但語序與常見表達方式略有出入，略顯生硬。\n第四個翻譯與第二個相同，語法正確，語感自然。\n第五個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日」缺少「年度」一詞，導致語義不完整。\n第六個翻譯與第二個相同，語法正確，語感自然。\n綜合考量語法正確性、語感自然度以及財務報告中常見的表達方式，最佳翻譯應為「截至2015年12月31日止年度」。此翻譯語法正確，語感自然，符合中文財務報告中常見的表達方式，且完整傳達了原句的語義。\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 資產負債表\n\n截至2015年12月31日\n\n陳德霖  \n貨幣管理局  \n2016 年 4 月 7 日\n\n第1.40頁至第222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 所有者權益變動表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n所有翻譯都正確地將「31」、「year」和「December」轉換為「31」、「年」和「12 月」，符合詞彙對應的要求。然而，從語法和語感的角度來看，翻譯的流暢度和自然度存在差異。\n第一個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日年度」語法上略顯不完整，缺少「止」字，使句子結構不完整。\n第二個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日止年度」語法正確，語感自然，符合中文財務報告中常見的表達方式。\n第三個翻譯「2015 年 12 月 31 日止年度」雖然語法正確，但語序與常見表達方式略有出入，略顯生硬。\n第四個翻譯與第二個相同，語法正確，語感自然。\n第五個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日」缺少「年度」一詞，導致語義不完整。\n第六個翻譯與第二個相同，語法正確，語感自然。\n綜合考量語法正確性、語感自然度以及財務報告中常見的表達方式，最佳翻譯應為「截至2015年12月31日止年度」。此翻譯語法正確，語感自然，符合中文財務報告中常見的表達方式，且完整傳達了原句的語義。\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 現金流量表\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n所有翻譯都正確地將「31」、「year」和「December」轉換為「31」、「年」和「12 月」，符合詞彙對應的要求。然而，從語法和語感的角度來看，翻譯的流暢度和自然度存在差異。\n第一個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日年度」語法上略顯不完整，缺少「止」字，使句子結構不完整。\n第二個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日止年度」語法正確，語感自然，符合中文財務報告中常見的表達方式。\n第三個翻譯「2015 年 12 月 31 日止年度」雖然語法正確，但語序與常見表達方式略有出入，略顯生硬。\n第四個翻譯與第二個相同，語法正確，語感自然。\n第五個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日」缺少「年度」一詞，導致語義不完整。\n第六個翻譯與第二個相同，語法正確，語感自然。\n綜合考量語法正確性、語感自然度以及財務報告中常見的表達方式，最佳翻譯應為「截至2015年12月31日止年度」。此翻譯語法正確，語感自然，符合中文財務報告中常見的表達方式，且完整傳達了原句的語義。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 現金流量表（繼續）\n\n截至2015年12月31日止年度\n所有翻譯都正確地將「31」、「year」和「December」轉換為「31」、「年」和「12 月」，符合詞彙對應的要求。然而，從語法和語感的角度來看，翻譯的流暢度和自然度存在差異。\n第一個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日年度」語法上略顯不完整，缺少「止」字，使句子結構不完整。\n第二個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日止年度」語法正確，語感自然，符合中文財務報告中常見的表達方式。\n第三個翻譯「2015 年 12 月 31 日止年度」雖然語法正確，但語序與常見表達方式略有出入，略顯生硬。\n第四個翻譯與第二個相同，語法正確，語感自然。\n第五個翻譯「截至2015年12月31日」缺少「年度」一詞，導致語義不完整。\n第六個翻譯與第二個相同，語法正確，語感自然。\n綜合考量語法正確性、語感自然度以及財務報告中常見的表達方式，最佳翻譯應為「截至2015年12月31日止年度」。此翻譯語法正確，語感自然，符合中文財務報告中常見的表達方式，且完整傳達了原句的語義。\n\n第140頁至第222頁的附註為這些財務報表的一部分。\n\n# 外匯基金 – 財務報表附註\n\n（數額以百萬港元列示，除非另有說明。）\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original English text is a parenthetical statement that specifies the currency and unit of measurement used for the figures presented, with an exception clause.

The best translation should use \"列示\" for \"expressed\" and \"百萬港元\" for \"millions of Hong Kong dollars.\" The phrase \"除非另有說明\" is the correct and idiomatic translation of \"unless otherwise stated.\"\nThus, the best possible translation is:  \n**（數額以百萬港元列示，除非另有說明。）**\n\n對子公司之投資，自控制實施日起至控制終止日止，均併入本集團財務報表。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n所有六個翻譯版本都正確使用了「實施」來翻譯「commences」，符合詞彙對應要求。整體而言，這些翻譯在語法和語意上都相當準確，但各有細節上的差異。\n1. **第一版**語句流暢，用詞準確，「自控制實施日起至控制停止日止」語序自然，但「停止」較少見於財務語境，「終止」更為正式。\n2. **第二版**語意清晰，但「開始實施」略顯重複，「開始」與「實施」語義重疊。\n3. **第三版**語句簡潔，但「至控制終止之日止」語序稍顯生硬。\n4. **第四版**使用「控制權」與「喪失」，語意更為具體，但「控制權」與原文「control」語義略有偏差，且「喪失」較為強調失去控制，與「cease」語意不完全一致。\n5. **第五版**語句流暢，語序自然，但「合併至集團財務報表中」語序略顯冗長。\n6. **第六版**語意準確，但「均納入集團財務報表中合併」語序混亂，「納入」與「合併」語義重複。\n綜合考量語法、語意、語境與語序，最佳翻譯應使用自然流暢的語序，並採用財務語境中常用的詞彙，如「終止」、「併入」、「財務報表」等。因此，最終翻譯採用簡潔自然的語序，並確保語意準確，符合財務專業語境。\n\n集團內往來餘額、交易及現金流量，以及源於集團內交易的任何未實現利潤及虧損，在編製集團財務報表時會被全數抵銷。\n\n非控制權益代表子公司中未直接或間接歸屬於基金的股權，且集團與該等權益持有人之間未另行協議任何增發條款，將導致集團整體對該等權益負有符合財務負債定義的契約義務。非控制權益在集團資產負債表中以權益項目呈交，並與歸屬於基金所有者的權益分開列示。集團業績中的非控制權益則在集團損益表及綜合收益表中以明細項目呈交，作為將本年總綜合收益或虧損及盈虧之間分配予非控制權益與基金所有者的部分。\n\n在基金的資產負債表中，其對子公司的投資以成本減去減值損失計，如有（附註2.14）。\n\n# 2.4 關聯企業及合資企業\n\n一個關聯實體是指集團透過其購買力參與該實體的財務及營運政策決策，而對其管理具有重大影響力，但並未擁有控制權或共同控制權之實體。\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n在評估六位初級翻譯員的翻譯時，我們發現他們在處理「entity」、「participate」和「power」這三個關鍵詞時，都正確使用了詞典中提供的對應詞彙：「實體」、「參與」和「購買力」。然而，翻譯的整體語感、語法正確性與語意清晰度仍有改進空間。\n1. **第一譯文**語意完整，語法正確，用詞自然，是目前最接近原意的翻譯。然而，「透過其購買力參與」的語序略顯生硬，可稍作調整以提升流暢度。\n2. **第二譯文**將「entity」翻譯為「聯營公司」，與原意不符，「entity」在此處應為「實體」，而非具體的企業類型。此外，「聯營公司」在會計語境中通常指「合營企業」，與「關聯實體」的定義不同。\n3. **第三譯文**語意清晰，但「這種影響力體現在集團參與該實體財務及營運政策決策的購買力上」語序較長，略顯拗口，影響閱讀流暢度。\n4. **第四譯文**同樣將「entity」誤譯為「聯營公司」，與原意不符，且語序較為混亂。\n5. **第五譯文**語意正確，但「透過其購買力參與財務和營運政策決策」語序略顯生硬，可調整語序以提升自然度。\n6. **第六譯文**語意正確，但語序與語感略顯平淡，缺乏一定的專業語氣。\n**改進方向：**\n- 確保「entity」正確翻譯為「實體」，避免誤譯為「聯營公司」或「合營企業」。\n- 調整語序，使句子更符合中文的語法習慣，例如將「透過其購買力參與」調整為「透過其購買力參與」或「透過其購買力來參與」。\n- 確保語句流暢自然，避免過於長或拗口的句式。\n- 維持專業語氣，符合會計或財務文件的語境。\n**最終翻譯：**\n一個關聯實體是指集團透過其購買力參與該實體的財務及營運政策決策，而對其管理具有重大影響力，但並未擁有控制權或共同控制權之實體。\n"}
