Junior translators mostly used \"отменить\" (infinitive of \"undo\") or \"отмена\" (noun form), but \"отменить\" aligns better with the verb form implied by \"Undo\" in UI contexts. The phrase \"преобразований\" (genitive plural) is grammatically incorrect here; \"преобразования\" (accusative plural) is required as the direct object of the verbs. Most translations incorrectly used genitive, likely due to confusion with prepositional phrases. The dictionary's \"повтор\" (noun) is awkward in this context, but it must be used as specified.

However, the fourth translation contains a typo (\"тирожирование\") and the seventh uses \"тиражирование\" (nominative case) instead of the required genitive \"тиражирования.\"  \n2. **Grammar and Case Usage:** The phrase \"в реальном времени\" is accurate for \"in real-time.\" However, \"тиражирования\" (genitive) is required after \"в,\" as in \"в тиражирования\" (in replication). The seventh translation incorrectly uses the nominative form.  \n3. **Verb Choice:** \"Приостановить\" (to suspend) is more active and appropriate for a command like \"Pause\" than \"Пауза\" (pause as a noun). Translations 3, 6, and 7 use \"Приостановить,\" which aligns better with the imperative tone of the original.  \n4. **Fluency and Cultural Appropriateness:** The phrase \"в режиме реального времени\" (in real-time mode) is slightly more technical than \"в реальном времени,\" but both are acceptable.

{"en":"Business Partner Type","terms":{"Partner":"партнера"},"ru":"<think>\nOkay, let's start by looking at the original text: \"Business Partner Type\". The dictionary specifies that \"Partner\" must be translated as \"партнера\". So the key term here is \"Partner\", which needs to be exactly \"партнера\".\nNow, looking at the junior translators' attempts. The first one did \"Тип бизнес-партнера\" which includes \"бизнес-\", which is \"business\" in Russian. But the original text is \"Business Partner Type\", so \"Business\" here is an adjective modifying \"Partner\". However, the dictionary only specifies \"Partner\" as \"партнера\", not \"Business Partner\" as a whole. So maybe \"бизнес-партнер\" is acceptable, but the dictionary doesn't mention that. Wait, the dictionary only has \"Partner\" as \"партнера\", so \"Business Partner\" would be \"бизнес-партнер\", but the user hasn't provided a translation for \"Business Partner\" as a term. So the junior translators might have added \"бизнес-\" on their own, which might not be necessary if the original term is just \"Partner\" and \"Business\" is part of the context.\nLooking at the translations, the second and third translators used \"Тип партнера\" without \"бизнес-\". The fourth and fifth also used \"бизнес-партнера\", and the sixth used \"делового партнера\" (which is \"business partner\" but \"деловой\" is more like \"business\" in the sense of commercial, whereas \"бизнес\" is more like \"business\" as in the company or enterprise). The seventh again used \"Тип партнера\".\nThe problem here is whether \"Business\" should be included. The original text is \"Business Partner Type\", which could be interpreted as \"Type of Business Partner\" or \"Type of Partner in Business\". However, the dictionary only specifies \"Partner\" as \"партнера\", so the user might expect that \"Business Partner\" is translated as \"бизнес-партнер\", but since the dictionary doesn't have that, maybe the correct approach is to use only \"партнера\" as per the dictionary, and not add \"бизнес-\" unless it's part of the term. However, the original text is \"Business Partner Type\", which is a title, so maybe \"бизнес-партнер\" is more accurate. But the dictionary doesn't have that, so the user might have intended that \"Partner\" is translated as \"партнера\", and \"Business\" is left as is, but that's not possible because \"Business\" is an English word. Wait, the original text is in English, so the user wants the translation to use the Russian equivalent for \"Partner\" but keep \"Business\" as part of the term. Wait, no, the original text is \"Business Partner Type\", which is a title. The user's dictionary says \"Partner\" must be \"партнера\", so the correct translation would be \"Тип партнера\" if \"Business\" is not part of the term. But the original text includes \"Business\", so maybe the user expects that \"Business Partner\" is translated as \"бизнес-партнер\", but since the dictionary only has \"Partner\" as \"партнера\", the user might have intended that \"Business Partner\" is translated as \"бизнес-партнер\", but the dictionary doesn't specify that. Therefore, the junior translators who added \"бизнес-\" might be correct, but the user's dictionary doesn't cover that. However, the user's instruction says to replace every term in the English text found as a key in the dictionary with the exact Russian equivalent. So \"Partner\" is a key, so it must be \"партнера\", but \"Business\" is not a key, so it should remain as is. Wait, but \"Business Partner\" is a compound term. If \"Partner\" is a key, then \"Business Partner\" would be \"бизнес-партнер\", but since \"Business\" isn't in the dictionary, it's not specified. Therefore, the correct approach is to translate \"Partner\" as \"партнера\" and leave \"Business\" as is, but that would result in \"Тип бизнес-партнера\", which is what some junior translators did. However, the user's dictionary doesn't have \"Business Partner\" as a key, so maybe the correct translation is \"Тип партнера\", but that omits \"Business\". This is a bit confusing. The user might have intended that \"Business Partner\" is translated as \"бизнес-партнер\", but since the dictionary only specifies \"Partner\" as \"партнера\", the user might have made a mistake in the dictionary. Alternatively, the user might have intended that \"Business Partner\" is a term that should be translated as \"бизнес-партнер\", but since the dictionary only has \"Partner\", the correct approach is to use \"партнера\" and leave \"Business\" as is. However, in Russian, \"бизнес-партнер\" is a common term, so including it might be better. But the user's instructions are strict: replace every term in the English text found as a key in the dictionary with the exact Russian equivalent. So \"Partner\" is a key, so it must be \"партнера\", but \"Business\" is not a key, so it's not translated. Therefore, the correct translation would be \"Тип бизнес-партнера\", which is what some junior translators did. However, the user's dictionary doesn't have \"Business Partner\" as a key, so the user might have intended that \"Business Partner\" is translated as \"бизнес-партнер\", but since the dictionary only has \"Partner\", the user might have made an error. Alternatively, the user might have intended that \"Business Partner\" is a term that should be translated as \"бизнес-партнер\", but since the dictionary only has \"Partner\", the correct approach is to use \"партнера\" and leave \"Business\" as is. Therefore, the correct translation would be \"Тип бизнес-партнера\", which is what some junior translators did.

{"en":"Overhead Allocation for CO-PA","terms":{"CO-PA":"CO-PA"},"ru":"Распределение накладных расходов по CO-PA\n**Review and Reasoning:**\n1. **Translation Accuracy:** The majority of translations correctly used \"Распределение накладных расходов\" for \"Overhead Allocation,\" which is the standard business term in Russian. However, the sixth translation (\"Распределение общих расходов\") incorrectly used \"общие расходы\" (general expenses) instead of \"накладные расходы\" (overhead), which is a critical error in financial terminology. The seventh translation (\"Накладные расходы на CO-PA\") omitted the key concept of \"allocation\" entirely.\n2. **Preposition Choice:** The preposition \"для\" (for) in translations 1,3,4,5 is grammatically correct but less idiomatic in Russian business contexts. The preposition \"по\" (by\/according to) is more natural when describing allocation mechanisms, as in \"распределение по [category].\" This aligns with how Russian financial documents typically structure such phrases.\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness:** The term \"накладные расходы\" is universally recognized in Russian accounting, ensuring clarity for professionals. Using \"общие расходы\" risks ambiguity, as it could refer to general operational costs rather than overhead specifically.\n4. **Consistency with Dictionary:** All translations correctly retained \"CO-PA\" as specified, avoiding unnecessary localization.\n**Improved Translation:**  \n\"Распределение накладных расходов по CO-PA\"  \nThis version uses the precise financial terminology, replaces \"для\" with the more natural \"по,\" and maintains the dictionary requirement for \"CO-PA.\" It ensures fluency and accuracy in a professional context."}

The phrase \"Where-Used List\" demands careful handling to preserve its technical nuance in manufacturing contexts. \n**Key Observations:**\n1. **Terminology Accuracy:** All translations correctly use \"партий\" for \"Batch\" and retain \"WIP.\" However, \"Where-Used\" is inconsistently rendered. The most accurate equivalents are \"Список мест использования\" (literally \"List of Places of Use\") or \"Список использования\" (simpler \"Usage List\"). The former better captures the \"where\" aspect, critical in inventory\/production contexts.\n2. **Fluency and Grammar:** \n   - Translations 3, 6, and 7 use \"Список мест использования,\" which is grammatically sound and contextually precise. \n   - Translations 1, 2, and 4 use \"Список использования,\" which is shorter but less specific. \n   - Translations 5 and 7 use lowercase \"список,\" which is less formal for a title. \n   - Translation 4 (\"Список использований\") uses the plural form \"использований,\" which is grammatically incorrect here (neuter noun \"список\" requires singular \"использования\").\n3. **Cultural Appropriateness:** In Russian technical documentation, titles often prioritize clarity over brevity. \"Список мест использования\" is standard in manufacturing contexts, while \"Где используется\" (directly \"Where is used\") feels too informal for a title.\n4. **Structural Consistency:** The original structure \"WIP Batch Where-Used List\" should be mirrored in Russian. Translations 1, 3, 6, and 7 maintain this order, while 4 and 5 invert it, reducing clarity.\n**Improvements:** \n- Retain \"WIP партий\" at the start to preserve the original structure. \n- Use \"Список мест использования\" for precision. \n- Capitalize \"Список\" as a title element. \n- Avoid lowercase \"список\" and plural \"использований.\"\n**Final Translation:**  \nWIP партий Список мест использования"}

{"en":"On the SAP Easy Access screen, choose Joint venture accountingPeriodic processingBillingExtract inv.\/statem.","terms":{"Joint":"Совместном"},"ru":"<think>\nOkay, let's start by looking at the original text and the dictionary. The key term here is \"Joint venture accounting\" which needs to be translated as \"Совместном\" according to the dictionary. The original instruction is to replace every term found in the dictionary with the exact Russian equivalent. So, \"Joint venture accounting\" should be \"Совместном\" in the translation.\nNow, looking at the junior translators' work. The first translation starts with \"Совместном учете инвестиций\/баланса\" which seems to take \"Joint venture accounting\" as \"Совместном учете инвестиций\/баланса\". But the dictionary only specifies \"Joint\" as \"Совместном\", not the full phrase. So maybe they added \"учете инвестиций\" which isn't in the dictionary. That might be an error.\nThe second translation uses \"бухгалтерию совместного предприятия\" which is \"accounting of a joint venture\". But the original term is \"Joint venture accounting\", which is more like \"accounting for joint ventures\" or \"joint venture accounting\". The dictionary only gives \"Joint\" as \"Совместном\", so maybe the correct approach is to use \"Совместном\" followed by the rest of the term. However, the original phrase is \"Joint venture accounting\", which is a specific term. The dictionary might be incomplete, but we have to follow it strictly.\nThird translation: \"Совместном предприятии\" which is \"in a joint enterprise\", but the original is \"Joint venture accounting\". So maybe they translated \"Joint venture\" as \"Совместном предприятии\" but missed the \"accounting\" part. The dictionary only has \"Joint\" as \"Совместном\", so perhaps the correct translation is \"Совместном\" followed by \"учет\" (accounting). But the original term is \"Joint venture accounting\", which is a specific module or process. Maybe the correct translation is \"Совместном учете\" (Joint accounting) but the dictionary only gives \"Joint\" as \"Совместном\", so the full term would be \"Совместном учете\" (Joint accounting). However, the original term is \"Joint venture accounting\", which is more specific. The dictionary might not have the full term, so we have to use \"Совместном\" as per the dictionary and then translate the rest normally.\nLooking at the other translations, some use \"Совместном предприятии\" which is \"in a joint enterprise\", but the original is \"Joint venture accounting\", which is a different term. The dictionary only provides \"Joint\" as \"Совместном\", so the correct approach is to replace \"Joint\" with \"Совместном\" and then translate the rest of the phrase. So \"Joint venture accounting\" would be \"Совместном учете\" (Joint accounting) but the original term is \"Joint venture accounting\", which might be a specific module in SAP. However, the dictionary doesn't provide the full term, so we have to use \"Совместном\" as per the dictionary and then translate the rest.

However, the dictionary only gives \"Joint\" as \"Совместном\", so the rest has to be translated normally. Therefore, \"Joint venture accounting\" would be \"Совместном учете\" (Joint accounting), but the original term is \"Joint venture accounting\", which is a specific term.

{"en":"The available hierarchy types include the following:","terms":{"available":"доступны"},"ru":"<think>\nOkay, let's start by looking at the original sentence: \"The available hierarchy types include the following:\" and the dictionary entry for 'available' is 'доступны'. The task is to check the junior translators' work and then produce the best translation.\nFirst, I need to check if all the translations correctly use 'доступны' where 'available' is in the original. Let's go through each one:\n1. \"Доступные типы иерархии включают следующие:\" – Here, 'доступные' is used, which is the adjective form. But the dictionary says 'доступны' which is the plural form of the adjective. Wait, 'доступны' is the plural form of 'доступный', so maybe the correct form here is 'доступны' instead of 'доступные'? Hmm, that's a possible mistake here. The original uses 'available' as an adjective, but in Russian, when the subject is plural, the adjective should agree in number. So if the subject is 'типы', which is plural, then the adjective should be 'доступны' (plural) rather than 'доступные' (nominative plural). Wait, but 'доступные' is the plural form of the adjective, but in this case, the subject is 'типы', which is plural, so the adjective should be in plural. However, 'доступны' is the plural form of the adjective, but in this context, the adjective is describing 'типы', so it should be 'доступные типы' (adjective in plural). Wait, maybe I'm confused here. Let me think again. The original sentence is \"The available hierarchy types include the following.\" So 'available' is an adjective modifying 'types'. In Russian, the adjective should agree with the noun in gender, number, and case. 'Типы' is plural, masculine, so the adjective should be in plural, masculine. 'Доступный' is the adjective, so plural would be 'доступные'. So 'доступные типы иерархии' is correct. However, the dictionary says 'доступны', which is the plural form of the adjective, but in this case, the adjective is used as a predicate. Wait, no. The original sentence uses 'available' as an adjective, not as a predicate. So the structure is \"The available hierarchy types include...\" which is \"Доступные типы иерархии включают...\" So the first junior translator used 'доступные', which is correct. But the dictionary says 'доступны', which is the plural form of the adjective. Wait, maybe the dictionary is incorrect? Or perhaps the user made a mistake. Wait, the dictionary entry is {'available': 'доступны'}, which is the plural form of the adjective. But in the original sentence, 'available' is an adjective modifying 'types', so it should be 'доступные' (plural). However, the dictionary says 'доступны', which is the plural form of the adjective, but in this context, it's used as a predicate. Wait, no. The original sentence is \"The available hierarchy types include the following.\" So the structure is \"The [available] hierarchy types include...\" which is \"Доступные типы иерархии включают следующие...\" So the adjective is in the nominative case, plural. Therefore, the correct form is 'доступные', not 'доступны'. But the dictionary says 'доступны', which is the plural form of the adjective. Wait, maybe the user intended 'доступны' as the correct translation, but that's not the case here. This is a possible error in the dictionary. However, the user's instruction is to use the exact Russian equivalents from the dictionary. So even if the dictionary is incorrect, we have to follow it. Wait, but the user says: \"Verify that all English terms matching keys in the dictionary below are correctly translated using the exact Russian equivalents provided.\" So if the dictionary says 'available' is 'доступны', then we must use that. But in the original sentence, 'available' is an adjective, so the correct translation would be 'доступные', but the dictionary says 'доступны'. This is a problem. However, the user's instruction is to use the exact Russian equivalents from the dictionary, so even if it's incorrect, we have to follow it. Therefore, the correct translation would be to use 'доступны' where 'available' is in the original. But in the original sentence, 'available' is an adjective, so the correct form would be 'доступные', but the dictionary says 'доступны'. This is conflicting. Wait, maybe the dictionary is using 'доступны' as the correct translation for 'available' in this context. But in Russian, 'доступны' is the plural form of the adjective, which would be used as a predicate. For example, \"Типы иерархии доступны\" (The hierarchy types are available). But in the original sentence, 'available' is an adjective modifying 'types', so it should be 'доступные типы иерархии'. However, the dictionary says 'доступны', which is the plural form of the adjective. So this is a possible mistake in the dictionary. But the user's instruction is to use the exact Russian equivalents from the dictionary. Therefore, even if it's incorrect, we have to use 'доступны' where 'available' is in the original. Therefore, the correct translation would be \"Доступны типы иерархии, включают следующие:\" but that's not correct. Wait, this is confusing. Let me check the junior translators' translations again.\nLooking at the first junior translator's translation: \"Доступные типы иерархии включают следующие:\" – here, 'доступные' is used, which is the correct form for the adjective modifying 'типы'. But the dictionary says 'доступны', which is the plural form of the adjective. So this is a discrepancy. However, the user's instruction is to use the exact Russian equivalents from the dictionary. Therefore, even if the junior translators used 'доступные', which is correct, but the dictionary says 'доступны', we have to use 'доступны' in our final translation. Wait, but the original sentence uses 'available' as an adjective, so the correct translation would be 'доступные', but the dictionary says 'доступны'. Therefore, the user might have made a mistake in the dictionary. However, the user's instruction is to follow the dictionary exactly. Therefore, the correct approach is to use 'доступны' where 'available' is in the original. But in the original sentence, 'available' is an adjective, so the correct form would be 'доступные', but the dictionary says 'доступны'. This is conflicting. However, the user's instruction is to use the exact Russian equivalents from the dictionary, so we have to use 'доступны' even if it's not the correct form. Therefore, the correct translation would be \"Доступны типы иерархии, включают следующие:\" but that's not grammatically correct. Wait, this is getting complicated. Maybe the dictionary is incorrect, but the user wants us to follow it. Therefore, the correct approach is to use 'доступны' where 'available' is in the original. So the original sentence is \"The available hierarchy types include the following:\" which would be \"Доступны типы иерархии, включают следующие:\" but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the dictionary is using 'доступны' as the correct translation for 'available' in this context, even though it's a different grammatical form. This is a possible error in the dictionary, but the user's instruction is to follow it. Therefore, the correct translation would be to use 'доступны' where 'available' is in the original. So the sentence would be \"Доступны типы иерархии, включают следующие:\" but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the dictionary is correct, and the junior translators made a mistake. For example, the fifth junior translator's translation is \"Доступны типы иерархии, включают следующие:\" which uses 'доступны' as the adjective, but that's incorrect because 'доступны' is the plural form of the adjective, which would be used as a predicate. So the correct structure would be \"Типы иерархии доступны, включают следующие:\" but that's not correct either. This is confusing. Maybe the correct translation is \"Доступные типы иерархии включают следующие:\" using 'доступные' as the adjective, which is the correct form. However, the dictionary says 'доступны', so the user might have intended that. Therefore, the best approach is to use 'доступны' as per the dictionary, even if it's not the correct grammatical form. Therefore, the correct translation would be \"Доступны типы иерархии, включают следующие:\" but that's not correct. Alternatively, maybe the dictionary is correct, and the junior translators made a mistake. For example, the second junior translator's translation is \"Доступны следующие типы иерархии:\" which uses 'доступны' as the predicate. So the structure is \"Доступны следующие типы иерархии:\" which is correct. But the original sentence is \"The available hierarchy types include the following:\" which is more like \"Доступные типы иерархии включают следующие:\" So the junior translators have different structures. The second and third translations use \"Доступны следующие типы иерархии:\" which is a passive structure, while the first and sixth use \"Доступные типы иерархии включают следующие:\" which is active. The correct structure would depend on the intended meaning. The original sentence is stating that the available types include the following, so the active voice is more direct. However, the passive structure is also acceptable. The dictionary says 'доступны', so the correct translation would be to use 'доступны' where 'available' is in the original. Therefore, the correct translation would be \"Доступны следующие типы иерархии:\" which is the second junior translator's version.

The key distinction lies in translating \"Transport Requests.\" \"Заявки на транспортировку\" (formal requests for transportation) and \"транспортные запросы\" (transport-related requests) are both valid, but \"транспортные запросы\" is more neutral and widely applicable in technical or software contexts. The second, fifth, and seventh translations use this phrasing, which aligns with common usage in systems or interfaces. Capitalization in the fourth translation (\"Транспортных Запросов\") is unnecessary unless it's a title. \"Заявки на транспортировку\" is slightly more formal but less precise for general \"requests.\" The best balance of clarity, fluency, and cultural appropriateness is achieved by \"транспортные запросы,\" making \"Просмотр транспортных запросов\" the optimal choice."}
{"en":"Work Agreement Tab","terms":{"Work":"Трудовой"},"ru":"Вкладка трудового договора\n**Review and Reasoning:**\nThe original text \"Work Agreement Tab\" requires translating \"Work\" as \"Трудовой\" (per the dictionary) and \"Tab\" as \"вкладка\" (standard UI terminology). Among the junior translations, options 6 and 7 (\"Вкладка трудового договора\") are grammatically correct, using the genitive case (\"трудового договора\") appropriately after \"вкладка.\" However, they lack quotation marks or formatting that would clarify this is a UI label. Option 1 (\"Трудовой договор - вкладка\") is awkwardly structured. Option 4 (\"Вкладка Трудовой Договор\") incorrectly capitalizes \"Договор\" (common nouns in Russian are not capitalized unless part of a proper noun). Option 5 (\"Вкладка трудового соглашения\") uses \"соглашение\" (agreement) instead of the required \"договор\" (contract). Option 2 (\"Табличка 'Трудовой договор'\") misuses \"табличка\" (label\/tag) instead of \"вкладка\" (tab). Option 3 (\"Статья о трудовом договоре\") is semantically incorrect, as \"статья\" means \"article,\" not \"tab.\"\n**Improvements:**\n- Use \"вкладка\" for \"Tab\" to align with UI conventions.\n- Apply the genitive case (\"трудового договора\") after \"вкладка\" for grammatical accuracy.\n- Add quotation marks or formatting to denote the label, though the original text omits them, so this is optional.\n- Ensure \"договор\" is used instead of \"соглашение\" for \"agreement\" as per the dictionary.\n**Final Translation:**\nВкладка трудового договора"}

{"en":"Transport Substitution Policy","terms":{"Substitution":"замены"},"ru":"Политика замены транспорта\nВсе переведенные варианты, кроме седьмого, корректно используют термин \"замены\" из словаря. Однако седьмой вариант \"Политика замен\" упускает ключевое слово \"транспорта\", что искажает смысл оригинала. Остальные варианты, включая второй (\"Политика замен транспорта\"), содержат грамматическую неточность: \"замены\" в данном контексте должно быть в единственном числе (номинатив), а не в родительном. Наиболее точным является вариант \"Политика замены транспорта\", где \"замены\" используется как существительное в номинативе, а \"транспорта\" — в предложном падеже, что соответствует структуре \"Policy of Transport Substitution\"."}
